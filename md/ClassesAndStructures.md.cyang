Classes and Structures 
----------------------

*Classes* and *structures* are general-purpose, flexible constructs that
become the building blocks of your program’s code. You define properties
and methods to add functionality to your classes and structures by using
exactly the same syntax as for constants, variables, and functions.

Unlike other programming languages, Swift does not require you to create
separate interface and implementation files for custom classes and
structures. In Swift, you define a class or a structure in a single
file, and the external interface to that class or structure is
automatically made available for other code to use.

Note

An instance of a *class* is traditionally known as an *object*. However,
Swift classes and structures are much closer in functionality than in
other languages, and much of this chapter describes functionality that
can apply to instances of *either* a class or a structure type. Because
of this, the more general term *instance* is used.

‌

### Comparing Classes and Structures 

Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

-   Define properties to store values

-   Define methods to provide functionality

-   Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript
    syntax

-   Define initializers to set up their initial state

-   Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default
    implementation

-   Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain
    kind

For more information, see [Properties](Properties.xhtml),
[Methods](Methods.xhtml), [Subscripts](Subscripts.xhtml),
[Initialization](Initialization.xhtml), [Extensions](Extensions.xhtml),
and [Protocols](Protocols.xhtml).

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

-   Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of
    another.

-   Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class
    instance at runtime.

-   Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any
    resources it has assigned.

-   Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class
    instance.

For more information, see [Inheritance](Inheritance.xhtml), [Type
Casting](TypeCasting.xhtml), [Initialization](Initialization.xhtml), and
[Automatic Reference Counting](AutomaticReferenceCounting.xhtml).

Note

Structures are always copied when they are passed around in your code,
and do not use reference counting.

‌

### Definition Syntax 

Classes and structures have a similar definition syntax. You introduce
classes with the class keyword and structures with the
struct keyword. Both place their entire definition within
a pair of braces:

    class {
        // class definition goes here
    }
    struct {
        // structure definition goes here
    }

Note

Whenever you define a new class or structure, you effectively define a
brand new Swift type. Give types UpperCamelCase names
(such as SomeClass here)
to match the capitalization of standard Swift types (such as
String).
Conversely, always give properties and methods
lowerCamelCase
and incrementCount) to differentiate them from type
names.

Here’s an example of a structure definition and a class definition:

    struct {
        var
        var
    }
    class {
        var()
        var
        var
        var?
    }

The example above defines a new structure called
Resolution, to describe a pixel-based display resolution.
This structure has two stored properties called width and
height. Stored properties are constants or variables that
are bundled up and stored as part of the class or structure. These two
properties are inferred to be of type Int by setting them
to an initial integer value of 0.

The example above also defines a new class called
VideoMode, to describe a specific video mode for video
display. This class has four variable stored properties. The first,
resolution, is initialized with a new
Resolution structure instance, which infers a property
type of Resolution. For the other three properties, new
VideoMode instances will be initialized with an
interlaced (meaning
“non-interlaced video”), a playback frame rate of 0.0,
and an optional String.
The name property is automatically given a default value
of nil value”, because it is
of an optional type.

‌

### Class and Structure Instances 

The Resolution structure definition and the
VideoMode class definition only describe what a
Resolution will look like.
They themselves do not describe a specific resolution or video mode. To
do that, you need to create an instance of the structure or class.

The syntax for creating instances is very similar for both structures
and classes:

    let()
    let()

Structures and classes both use initializer syntax for new instances.
The simplest form of initializer syntax uses the type name of the class
or structure followed by empty parentheses, such as
Resolution(). This creates
a new instance of the class or structure, with any properties
initialized to their default values. Class and structure initialization
is described in more detail in [Initialization](Initialization.xhtml).

‌

### Accessing Properties 

You can access the properties of an instance using *dot syntax*. In dot
syntax, you write the property name immediately after the instance name,
separated by a period (.), without any spaces:

    println)
    // prints "The width of someResolution is 0"

In this example, someResolution.width refers to the
width, and
returns its default initial value of 0.

You can drill down into sub-properties, such as the width
property in the resolution property of a
VideoMode:

    println)
    // prints "The width of someVideoMode is 0"

You can also use dot syntax to assign a new value to a variable
property:

    someVideoMode =
    1280
    println)
    // prints "The width of someVideoMode is now 1280"

Note

Unlike Objective-C, Swift enables you to set sub-properties of a
structure property directly. In the last example above, the
width property
of someVideoMode is set directly, without your needing to
set the entire resolution property to a new value.

‌

### Memberwise Initializers for Structure Types 

All structures have an automatically-generated *memberwise initializer*,
which you can use to initialize the member properties of new structure
instances. Initial values for the properties of the new instance can be
passed to the memberwise initializer by name:

    let:
    640)

Unlike structures, class instances do not receive a default memberwise
initializer. Initializers are described in more detail in
[Initialization](Initialization.xhtml).

‌

### Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types 

A *value type* is a type that is *copied* when it is assigned to a
variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.

You’ve actually been using value types extensively throughout the
previous chapters. In fact, all of the basic types in Swift—integers,
floating-point numbers, Booleans, strings, arrays and dictionaries—are
value types, and are implemented as structures behind the scenes.

All structures and enumerations are value types in Swift. This means
that any structure and enumeration instances you create—and any value
types they have as properties—are always copied when they are passed
around in your code.

Consider this example, which uses the Resolution
structure from the previous example:

    let:
    1920)
    var

This example declares a constant called hd and sets it to
a Resolution instance initialized with the width and
height of full HD video (1920 pixels wide by
1080 pixels high).

It then declares a variable called cinema and sets it to
the current value of hd. Because
Resolution is a structure, a *copy* of the existing
instance is made, and this new copy is assigned to
cinema and
cinema now have the same width and height, they are two
completely different instances behind the scenes.

Next, the width is
amended to be the width of the slightly-wider 2K standard used for
digital cinema projection (2048 pixels wide and
1080 pixels high):

    cinema

Checking the width
shows that it has indeed changed to be 2048:

    println)
    // prints "cinema is now 2048 pixels wide"

However, the width property of the original
hd instance still has the old value of
1920:

    println)
    // prints "hd is still 1920 pixels wide"

When cinema was given the current value of
hd were copied
into the new cinema instance. The end result is two
completely separate instances, which just happened to contain the same
numeric values. Because they are separate instances, setting the width
of cinema doesn’t affect the width
stored in hd.

The same behavior applies to enumerations:

    enum {
        case,
    West
    }
    var =
    CompassPoint
    let =
    currentDirection
    currentDirection
    if {
        println)
    }
    // prints "The remembered direction is still .West"

When rememberedDirection is assigned the value of
currentDirection, it is actually set to a copy of that
value. Changing the value of currentDirection thereafter
does not affect the copy of the original value that was stored in
rememberedDirection.

‌

### Classes Are Reference Types 

Unlike value types, *reference types* are *not* copied when they are
assigned to a variable or constant, or when they are passed to a
function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance
is used instead.

Here’s an example, using the VideoMode class defined
above:

    let()
    tenEighty
    tenEighty
    tenEighty
    tenEighty

This example declares a new constant called tenEighty and
sets it to refer to a new instance of the VideoMode
class. The video mode is assigned a copy of the HD resolution of
1920 from before. It is set to be
interlaced, and is given a name of "1080i". Finally, it
is set to a frame rate of 25.0 frames per second.

Next, tenEighty is assigned to a new constant, called
alsoTenEighty, and the frame rate of
alsoTenEighty is modified:

    let
    alsoTenEighty

Because classes are reference types, tenEighty and
alsoTenEighty actually both refer to the *same*
VideoMode instance. Effectively, they are just two
different names for the same single instance.

Checking the frameRate property of
tenEighty shows that it correctly reports the new frame
rate of 30.0
instance:

    println)
    // prints "The frameRate property of tenEighty is now 30.0"

Note that tenEighty are
declared as *constants*, rather than variables. However, you can still
change tenEighty.frameRate and
alsoTenEighty.frameRate because the values of the
tenEighty constants
themselves do not actually change. tenEighty and
alsoTenEighty themselves do not “store” the
VideoMode instance—instead, they both *refer* to a
VideoMode instance behind the scenes. It is the
frameRate property of the underlying
VideoMode that is changed, not the values of the constant
references to that VideoMode.

‌

### Identity Operators 

Because classes are reference types, it is possible for multiple
constants and variables to refer to the same single instance of a class
behind the scenes. (The same is not true for structures and
enumerations, because they are value types and are always copied when
they are assigned to a constant or variable, or passed to a function.)

It can sometimes be useful to find out if two constants or variables
refer to exactly the same instance of a class. To enable this, Swift
provides two identity operators:

-   Identical to (===)

-   Not identical to (!==)

Use these operators to check whether two constants or variables refer to
the same single instance:

    if {
        println)
    }
    // prints "tenEighty and alsoTenEighty refer to the same Resolution instance."

Note that “identical to” (represented by three equals signs, or
===) does not mean the same thing as “equal to”
(represented by two equals signs, or ==):

-   “Identical to” means that two constants or variables of class type
    refer to exactly the same class instance.

-   “Equal to” means that two instances are considered “equal” or
    “equivalent” in value, for some appropriate meaning of “equal”, as
    defined by the type’s designer.

When you define your own custom classes and structures, it is your
responsibility to decide what qualifies as two instances being “equal”.
The process of defining your own implementations of the “equal to” and
“not equal to” operators is described in [Equivalence
Operators](AdvancedOperators.xhtml#TP40014097-CH27-XID_47).

‌

### Pointers 

If you have experience with C, C++, or Objective-C, you may know that
these languages use *pointers* to refer to addresses in memory. A Swift
constant or variable that refers to an instance of some reference type
is similar to a pointer in C, but is not a direct pointer to an address
in memory, and does not require you to write an asterisk
(*) to indicate that you are creating a reference.
Instead, these references are defined like any other constant or
variable in Swift.

‌

### Choosing Between Classes and Structures 

You can use both classes and structures to define custom data types to
use as the building blocks of your program’s code.

However, structure instances are always passed by *value*, and class
instances are always passed by *reference*. This means that they are
suited to different kinds of tasks. As you consider the data constructs
and functionality that you need for a project, decide whether each data
construct should be defined as a class or as a structure.

As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more
of these conditions apply:

-   The structure’s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively
    simple data values.

-   It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be
    copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an
    instance of that structure.

-   Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types,
    which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced.

-   The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from
    another existing type.

Examples of good candidates for structures include:

-   The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a
    width property,
    both of type Double.

-   A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a
    start property,
    both of type Int.

-   A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating
    x properties,
    each of type Double.

In all other cases, define a class, and create instances of that class
to be managed and passed by reference. In practice, this means that most
custom data constructs should be classes, not structures.

‌

### Assignment and Copy Behavior for Collection Types 

Swift’s Array types are
implemented as structures. However, arrays have slightly different
copying behavior from dictionaries and other structures when they are
assigned to a constant or variable, and when they are passed to a
function or method.

The behavior described for Array and
Dictionary below is different again from the behavior of
NSArray in Foundation,
which are implemented as classes, not structures. NSArray
and NSDictionary instances are always assigned and passed
around as a reference to an existing instance, rather than as a copy.

Note

The descriptions below refer to the “copying” of arrays, dictionaries,
strings, and other values. Where copying is mentioned, the behavior you
see in your code will always be as if a copy took place. However, Swift
only performs an *actual* copy behind the scenes when it is absolutely
necessary to do so. Swift manages all value copying to ensure optimal
performance, and you should not avoid assignment to try to preempt this
optimization.

‌

### Assignment and Copy Behavior for Dictionaries 

Whenever you assign a Dictionary instance to a constant
or variable, or pass a Dictionary instance as an argument
to a function or method call, the dictionary is *copied* at the point
that the assignment or call takes place. This process is described in
[Structures and Enumerations Are Value
Types](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_104).

If the keys and/or values stored in the Dictionary
instance are value types (structures or enumerations), they too are
copied when the assignment or call takes place. Conversely, if the keys
and/or values are reference types (classes or functions), the references
are copied, but not the class instances or functions that they refer to.
This copy behavior for a dictionary’s keys and values is the same as the
copy behavior for a structure’s stored properties when the structure is
copied.

The example below defines a dictionary called ages, which
stores the names and ages of four people. The ages
dictionary is then assigned to a new variable called
copiedAges and is copied when this assignment takes
place. After the assignment, ages and
copiedAges are two separate dictionaries.

    var,
    "Wei":
    19]
    var

The keys for this dictionary are of type String, and the
values are of type Int. Both types are value types in
Swift, and so the keys and values are also copied when the dictionary
copy takes place.

You can prove that the ages dictionary has been copied by
changing an age value in one of the dictionaries and checking the
corresponding value in the other. If you set the value for
"Peter" dictionary to
24 dictionary still returns the
old value of 23 from before the copy took place:

    copiedAges
    println])
    // prints "23"

‌

### Assignment and Copy Behavior for Arrays 

The assignment and copy behavior for Swift’s Array type
is more complex than for its Dictionary type.
Array provides C-like performance when you work with an
array’s contents and copies an array’s contents only when copying is
necessary.

If you assign an Array instance to a constant or
variable, or pass an Array instance as an argument to a
function or method call, the contents of the array are *not* copied at
the point that the assignment or call takes place. Instead, both arrays
share the same sequence of element values. When you modify an element
value through one array, the result is observable through the other.

For arrays, copying only takes place when you perform an action that has
the potential to modify the *length* of the array. This includes
appending, inserting, or removing items, or using a ranged subscript to
replace a range of items in the array. If and when array copying does
take place, the copy behavior for an array’s contents is the same as for
a dictionary’s keys and values, as described in [Assignment and Copy
Behavior for
Dictionaries](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_111).

The example below assigns a new array of Int values to a
variable called a. This array is also assigned to two
further variables called b:

    var]
    var
    var

You can retrieve the first value in the array with subscript syntax on
either a:

    println])
    // 1
    println])
    // 1
    println])
    // 1

If you set an item in the array to a new value with subscript syntax,
all three of a
will return the new value. Note that the array is not copied when you
set a new value with subscript syntax, because setting a single value
with subscript syntax does not have the potential to change the array’s
length:

    a
    println])
    // 42
    println])
    // 42
    println])
    // 42

However, if you append a new item to a, you *do* modify
the array’s length. This prompts Swift to create a new copy of the array
at the point that you append the new value. Henceforth, a
is a separate, independent copy of the array.

If you change a value in a after the copy is made,
a and
c, which both still reference the original array contents
from before the copy took place:

    a)
    a
    println])
    // 777
    println])
    // 42
    println])
    // 42

‌

### Ensuring That an Array Is Unique 

It can be useful to ensure that you have a unique copy of an array
before performing an action on that array’s contents, or before passing
that array to a function or method. You ensure the uniqueness of an
array reference by calling the unshare method on a
variable of array type. (The unshare method cannot be
called on a constant array.)

If multiple variables currently refer to the same array, and you call
the unshare method on one of those variables, the array
is copied, so that the variable has its own independent copy of the
array. However, no copying takes place if the variable is already the
only reference to the array.

At the end of the previous example, b and
c both reference the same array. Call the
unshare to make it become a
unique copy:

    b()

If you change the first value in b after calling the
unshare method, all three arrays will now report a
different value:

    b
    println])
    // 777
    println])
    // -105
    println])
    // 42

‌

### Checking Whether Two Arrays Share the Same Elements 

Check whether two arrays or subarrays share the same storage and
elements by comparing them with the identity operators
(===).

The example below uses the “identical to” operator (===)
to check whether b still share the
same array elements:

    if {
        println)
    } else {
        println)
    }
    // prints "b and c now refer to two independent sets of array elements."

Alternatively, use the identity operators to check whether two subarrays
share the same elements. The example below compares two identical
subarrays from b and confirms that they refer to the same
elements:

    if] ===
    b] {
        println)
    } else {
        println)
    }
    // prints "These two subarrays share the same elements."

‌

### Forcing a Copy of an Array 

Force an explicit copy of an array by calling the array’s
copy method. This method performs a shallow copy of the
array and returns a new array containing the copied items.

The example below defines an array called names, which
stores the names of seven people. A new variable called
copiedNames is set to the result of calling the
copy array:

    var,
    "Justyn",
    "Vic"]
    var()

You can prove that the names array has been copied by
changing an item in one of the arrays and checking the corresponding
item in the other. If you set the first item in the
copiedNames rather than
"Mohsen" array still returns
the old value of "Mohsen" from before the copy took
place:

    copiedNames
    println])
    // prints "Mohsen"

Note

If you simply need to be sure that your reference to an array’s contents
is the only reference in existence, call the unshare
method, not the copy
method does not make a copy of the array unless it is necessary to do
so. The copy method always copies the array, even if it
is already unshared.
