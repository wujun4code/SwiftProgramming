Declarations 
------------

A *declaration* introduces a new name or construct into your program.
For example, you use declarations to introduce functions and methods,
variables and constants, and to define new, named enumeration,
structure, class, and protocol types. You can also use a declaration to
extend the the behavior of an existing named type and to import symbols
into your program that are declared elsewhere.

In Swift, most declarations are also definitions in the sense that they
are implemented or initialized at the same time they are declared. That
said, because protocols don’t implement their members, most protocol
members are declarations only. For convenience and because the
distinction isn’t that important in Swift, the term *declaration* covers
both declarations and definitions.

### Module Scope 

The module scope defines the code that’s visible to other code in Swift
source files that are part of the same module. The top-level code in a
Swift source file consists of zero or more statements, declarations, and
expressions. Variables, constants, and other named declarations that are
declared at the top-level of a source file are visible to code in every
source file that is part of the same module.

‌

### Code Blocks 

A *code block* is used by a variety of declarations and control
structures to group statements together. It has the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The *statements* inside a code block include declarations, expressions,
and other kinds of statements and are executed in order of their
appearance in source code.

### Import Declaration 

An *import declaration* lets you access symbols that are declared
outside the current file. The basic form imports the entire module; it
consists of the import keyword followed by a module name:

-   ~~~~ 
    import module
    ~~~~

Providing more detail limits which symbols are imported—you can specify
a specific submodule or a specific declaration within a module or
submodule. When this detailed form is used, only the imported symbol
(and not the module that declares it) is made available in the current
scope.

-   ~~~~ 
    import import kind module.symbol name
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    import module.submodule
    ~~~~

‌ import-path-identifier →

‌

### Constant Declaration 

A *constant declaration* introduces a constant named value into your
program. Constant declarations are declared using the keyword
let and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    let constant name: type = expression
    ~~~~

A constant declaration defines an immutable binding between the
*constant name* and the value of the initializer *expression*; after the
value of a constant is set, it cannot be changed. That said, if a
constant is initialized with a class object, the object itself can
change, but the binding between the constant name and the object it
refers to can’t.

When a constant is declared at global scope, it must be initialized with
a value. When a constant declaration occurs in the context of a class or
structure declaration, it is considered a *constant property*. Constant
declarations are not computed properties and therefore do not have
getters or setters.

If the *constant name* of a constant declaration is a tuple pattern, the
name of each item in the tuple is bound to the corresponding value in
the initializer *expression*.

    let) =
    (10)

In this example, firstNumber is a named constant for the
value 10 is a named
constant for the value 42. Both constants can now be used
independently:

    println)
    // prints "The first number is 10."
    println)
    // prints "The second number is 42."

The type annotation (: *type*) is optional in a constant
declaration when the type of the *constant name* can be inferred, as
described in [Type Inference](Types.xhtml#TP40014097-CH31-XID_1029).

To declare a static constant property, mark the declaration with the
static keyword. Static properties are discussed in [Type
Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_339).

For more information about constants and for guidance about when to use
them, see [Constants and
Variables](TheBasics.xhtml#TP40014097-CH5-XID_400) and [Stored
Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_324).

‌

### Variable Declaration 

A *variable declaration* introduces a variable named value into your
program and is declared using the keyword var.

Variable declarations have several forms that declare different kinds of
named, mutable values, including stored and computed variables and
properties, stored variable and property observers, and static variable
properties. The appropriate form to use depends on the scope at which
the variable is declared and the kind of variable you intend to declare.

Note

You can also declare properties in the context of a protocol
declaration, as described in [Protocol Property
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_610).

You can override a property in a subclass by prefixing the subclass’s
property declaration with the override keyword, as
described in [Overriding](Inheritance.xhtml#TP40014097-CH17-XID_257).

‌

### Stored Variables and Stored Variable Properties 

The following form declares a stored variable or stored variable
property:

-   ~~~~ 
    var variable name: type = expression
    ~~~~

You define this form of a variable declaration at global scope, the
local scope of a function, or in the context of a class or structure
declaration. When a variable declaration of this form is declared at
global scope or the local scope of a function, it is referred to as a
*stored variable*. When it is declared in the context of a class or
structure declaration, it is referred to as a *stored variable
property*.

The initializer *expression* can’t be present in a protocol declaration,
but in all other contexts, the initializer *expression* is optional.
That said, if no initializer *expression* is present, the variable
declaration must include an explicit type annotation (:
*type*).

As with constant declarations, if the *variable name* is a tuple
pattern, the name of each item in the tuple is bound to the
corresponding value in the initializer *expression*.

As their names suggest, the value of a stored variable or a stored
variable property is stored in memory.

‌

### Computed Variables and Computed Properties 

The following form declares a computed variable or computed property:

-   ~~~~ 
    var variable name: type {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    get {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    set(setter name) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

You define this form of a variable declaration at global scope, the
local scope of a function, or in the context of a class, structure,
enumeration, or extension declaration. When a variable declaration of
this form is declared at global scope or the local scope of a function,
it is referred to as a *computed variable*. When it is declared in the
context of a class, structure, or extension declaration, it is referred
to as a *computed property*.

The getter is used to read the value, and the setter is used to write
the value. The setter clause is optional, and when only a getter is
needed, you can omit both clauses and simply return the requested value
directly, as described in [Read-Only Computed
Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_331). But if you
provide a setter clause, you must also provide a getter clause.

The *setter name* and enclosing parentheses is optional. If you provide
a setter name, it is used as the name of the parameter to the setter. If
you do not provide a setter name, the default parameter name to the
setter is newValue, as described in [Shorthand Setter
Declaration](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_330).

Unlike stored named values and stored variable properties, the value of
a computed named value or a computed property is not stored in memory.

For more information and to see examples of computed properties, see
[Computed Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_329).

‌

### Stored Variable Observers and Property Observers 

You can also declare a stored variable or property with
willSet observers. A stored
variable or property declared with observers has the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    var variable name: type = expression {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    willSet(setter name) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    didSet(setter name {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

You define this form of a variable declaration at global scope, the
local scope of a function, or in the context of a class or structure
declaration. When a variable declaration of this form is declared at
global scope or the local scope of a function, the observers are
referred to as *stored variable observers*. When it is declared in the
context of a class or structure declaration, the observers are referred
to as *property observers*.

You can add property observers to any stored property. You can also add
property observers to any inherited property (whether stored or
computed) by overriding the property within a subclass, as described in
[Overriding Property
Observers](Inheritance.xhtml#TP40014097-CH17-XID_263).

The initializer *expression* is optional in the context of a class or
structure declaration, but required elsewhere. The type annotation is
required in all variable declarations that include observers, regardless
of the context in which they are declared.

The willSet observers provide a
way to observe (and to respond appropriately) when the value of a
variable or property is being set. The observers are not called when the
variable or property is first initialized. Instead, they are called only
when the value is set outside of an initialization context.

A willSet observer is called just before the value of the
variable or property is set. The new value is passed to the
willSet observer as a constant, and therefore it can’t be
changed in the implementation of the willSet clause. The
didSet observer is called immediately after the new value
is set. In contrast to the willSet observer, the old
value of the variable or property is passed to the didSet
observer in case you still need access to it. That said, if you assign a
value to a variable or property within its own didSet
observer clause, that new value that you assign will replace the one
that was just set and passed to the willSet observer.

The *setter name* and enclosing parentheses in the
willSet clauses are optional.
If you provide setter names, they are used as the parameter names to the
willSet observers. If you do
not provide setter names, the default parameter name to the
willSet and the
default parameter name to the didSet observer is
oldValue.

The didSet clause is optional when you provide a
willSet
clause is optional when you provide a didSet clause.

For more information and to see an example of how to use property
observers, see [Property
Observers](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_333).

‌

### Class and Static Variable Properties 

To declare a class computed property, mark the declaration with the
class keyword. To declare a static variable property,
mark the declaration with the static keyword. Class and
static properties are discussed in [Type
Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_339).

### Type Alias Declaration 

A *type alias declaration* introduces a named alias of an existing type
into your program. Type alias declarations begin with the keyword
typealias and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    typealias name = existing type
    ~~~~

After a type alias is declared, the aliased *name* can be used instead
of the *existing type* everywhere in your program. The *existing type*
can be a named type or a compound type. Type aliases do not create new
types; they simply allow a name to refer to an existing type.

See also [Protocol Associated Type
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_622).

‌ typealias-name → [identifier](LexicalStructure.xhtml#identifier)

‌ typealias-assignment → =[type](Types.xhtml#type)

‌

### Function Declaration 

A :newTerm\function declaration\ introduces a function or method into
your program. A function declared in the context of class, structure,
enumeration, or protocol is referred to as a *method*. Function
declarations are declared using the keyword func and have
the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    func function name(parameters) -> return type {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

If the function has a return type of Void, the return
type can be omitted as follows:

-   ~~~~ 
    func function name(parameters) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The type of each parameter must be included—it can’t be inferred. By
default, the parameters to a function are constants. Write
var in front of a parameter’s name to make it a variable,
scoping any changes made to the variable just to the function body, or
write inout to make those changes also apply to the
argument that was passed in the caller’s scope. For a discussion of
in-out parameters, see [In-Out
Parameters](Functions.xhtml#TP40014097-CH10-XID_226).

Functions can return multiple values using a tuple type as the return
type of the function.

A function definition can appear inside another function declaration.
This kind of function is known as a *nested function*. For a discussion
of nested functions, see [Nested
Functions](Functions.xhtml#TP40014097-CH10-XID_233).

‌

### Parameter Names 

Function parameters are a comma separated list where each parameter has
one of several forms. The order of arguments in a function call must
match the order of parameters in the function’s declaration. The
simplest entry in a parameter list has the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    parameter name: parameter type
    ~~~~

For function parameters, the parameter name is used within the function
body, but is not used when calling the function. For method parameters,
the parameter name is used as within the function body, and is also used
as a label for the argument when calling the method. The name of a
method’s first parameter is used only within the function body, like the
parameter of a function. For example:

    func:
    String {
        return)
    }
    f)
    // x and y have no name
     
    class {
        func:
    String {
            return)
        }
    }
    let()
    c)
    // x has no name, y has a name

You can override the default behavior for how parameter names are used
with one of the following forms:

-   ~~~~ 
    external parameter name local parameter name: parameter type
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    #parameter name: parameter type
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    _ local parameter name: parameter type
    ~~~~

A second name before the local parameter name gives the parameter an
external name, which can be different than the local parameter name. The
external parameter name must be used when the function is called. The
corresponding argument must have the external name in function or method
calls.

A hash symbol (#) before a parameter name indicates that
the name should be used as both an external and a local parameter name.
It has the same meaning as writing the local parameter name twice. The
corresponding argument must have this name in function or method calls.

An underscore (_) before a local parameter name gives
that parameter no name to be used in function calls. The corresponding
argument must have no name in function or method calls.

‌

### Special Kinds of Parameters 

Parameters can be ignored, take a variable number of values, and provide
default values using the following forms:

-   ~~~~ 
    _ : <#parameter type#.
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    parameter name: parameter type...
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    parameter name: parameter type = default argument value
    ~~~~

A parameter named with an underscore (_) is explicitly
ignored an can’t be accessed within the body of the function.

A parameter with a base type name followed immediately by three dots
(...) is understood as a variadic parameter. A function
can have at most one variadic parameter, which must be its last
parameter. A variadic parameter is treated as an array that contains
elements of the base type name. For instance, the variadic parameter
Int.... For an example
that uses a variadic parameter, see [Variadic
Parameters](Functions.xhtml#TP40014097-CH10-XID_222).

A parameter with an equals sign (=) and an expression
after its type is understood to have a default value of the given
expression. If the parameter is omitted when calling the function, the
default value is used instead. If the parameter is not omitted, it must
have its name in the function call. For example, f() and
f(x: 7) are both valid calls to a function with a single
default parameter named x is
invalid because it provides a value without a name.

‌

### Special Kinds of Methods 

Methods on an enumeration or a structure that modify self
must be marked with the mutating keyword at the start of
the function declaration.

Methods that override a superclass method must be marked with the
override keyword at the start of the function
declaration. It is an error to override a method without the
override
keyword on a method that doesn’t override a superclass method.

Methods associated with a type rather than an instance of a type must be
marked with the static attribute for enumerations and
structures or the class attribute for classes.

‌

### Curried Functions and Methods 

Curried functions and methods have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    func function name(parameters)(parameters) -> return type {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

A function declared this way is understood as a function whose return
type is another function. For example, the following two declarations
are equivalent:

    func:
    Int {
        return
    }
    func) -\>
    (Int) {
        func:
    Int {
            return
        }
        return
    }
     
    addTwoNumbers

Multiple levels of currying are allowed.

‌

### Enumeration Declaration 

An *enumeration declaration* introduces a named enumeration type into
your program.

Enumeration declarations have two basic forms and are declared using the
keyword enum. The body of an enumeration declared using
either form contains zero or more values—called *enumeration cases*—and
any number of declarations, including computed properties, instance
methods, static methods, initializers, type aliases, and even other
enumeration, structure, and class declarations. Enumeration declarations
can’t contain destructor or protocol declarations.

Unlike classes and structures, enumeration types do not have an
implicitly provided default initializer; all initializers must be
declared explicitly. Initializers can delegate to other initializers in
the enumeration, but the initialization process is complete only after
an initializer assigns one of the enumeration cases to
self.

Like structures but unlike classes, enumerations are value types;
instances of an enumeration are copied when assigned to variables or
constants, or when passed as arguments to a function call. For
information about value types, see [Structures and Enumerations Are
Value Types](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_104).

You can extend the behavior of an enumeration type with an extension
declaration, as discussed in [Extension
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_633).

‌

### Enumerations with Cases of Any Type 

The following form declares an enumeration type that contains
enumeration cases of any type:

-   ~~~~ 
    enum enumeration name {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        case enumeration case 1
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        case enumeration case 2(associated value types)
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

Enumerations declared in this form are sometimes called *discriminated
unions* in other programming languages.

In this form, each case block consists of the keyword
case followed by one or more enumeration cases, separated
by commas. The name of each case must be unique. Each case can also
specify that it stores values of a given type. These types are specified
in the *associated value types* tuple, immediately following the name of
the case. For more information and to see examples of cases with
associated value types, see [Associated
Values](Enumerations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH12-XID_189).

‌

### Enumerations with Raw Cases Values 

The following form declares an enumeration type that contains
enumeration cases of the same basic type:

-   ~~~~ 
    enum enumeration name: raw value type {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        case enumeration case 1 = raw value 1
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        case enumeration case 2 = raw value 2
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

In this form, each case block consists of the keyword
case, followed by one or more enumeration cases,
separated by commas. Unlike the cases in the first form, each case has
an underlying value, called a *raw value*, of the same basic type. The
type of these values is specified in the *raw value type* and must
represent a literal integer, floating-point number, character, or
string.

Each case must have a unique name and be assigned a unique raw value. If
the raw value type is specified as Int and you don’t
assign a value to the cases explicitly, they are implicitly assigned the
values 0, and so on.
Each unassigned case of type Int is implicitly assigned a
raw value that is automatically incremented from the raw value of the
previous case.

    enum {
        case,
    D
    }

In the above example, the value of ExampleEnum.A is
0 is
1
is explicitly set to 5, the value of
ExampleEnum.D is automatically incremented from
5.

The raw value of an enumeration case can be accessed by calling its
toRaw.
You can also use a raw value to find a corresponding case, if there is
one, by calling the fromRaw method, which returns an
optional case. For more information and to see examples of cases with
raw value types, see [Raw
Values](Enumerations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH12-XID_190).

‌

### Accessing Enumeration Cases 

To reference the case of an enumeration type, use dot (.)
syntax, as in EnumerationType.EnumerationCase. When the
enumeration type can be inferred from context, you can omit it (the dot
is still required), as described in [Enumeration
Syntax](Enumerations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH12-XID_186) and [Implicit Member
Expression](Expressions.xhtml#TP40014097-CH32-XID_724).

To check the values of enumeration cases, use a switch
statement, as shown in [Matching Enumeration Values with a Switch
Statement](Enumerations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH12-XID_188). The enumeration
type is pattern-matched against the enumeration case patterns in the
case blocks of the switch statement, as described in
[Enumeration Case Pattern](Patterns.xhtml#TP40014097-CH36-XID_901).

### Structure Declaration 

A *structure declaration* introduces a named structure type into your
program. Structure declarations are declared using the keyword
struct and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    struct structure name: adopted protocols {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        declarations
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The body of a structure contains zero or more *declarations*. These
*declarations* can include both stored and computed properties, static
properties, instance methods, static methods, initializers, type
aliases, and even other structure, class, and enumeration declarations.
Structure declarations can’t contain destructor or protocol
declarations. For a discussion and several examples of structures that
include various kinds of declarations, see [Classes and
Structures](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml).

Structure types can adopt any number of protocols, but can’t inherit
from classes, enumerations, or other structures.

There are three ways create an instance of a previously declared
structure:

-   Call one of the initializers declared within the structure, as
    described in
    [Initializers](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_269).

-   If no initializers are declared, call the structure’s memberwise
    initializer, as described in [Memberwise Initializers for Structure
    Types](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_280).

-   If no initializers are declared, and all properties of the structure
    declaration were given initial values, call the structure’s default
    initializer, as described in [Default
    Initializers](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_279).

The process of initializing a structure’s declared properties is
described in [Initialization](Initialization.xhtml).

Properties of a structure instance can be accessed using dot
(.) syntax, as described in [Accessing
Properties](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_101).

Structures are value types; instances of a structure are copied when
assigned to variables or constants, or when passed as arguments to a
function call. For information about value types, see [Structures and
Enumerations Are Value
Types](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_104).

You can extend the behavior of a structure type with an extension
declaration, as discussed in [Extension
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_633).

### Class Declaration 

A *class declaration* introduces a named class type into your program.
Class declarations are declared using the keyword class
and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    class class name: superclass, adopted protocols {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        declarations
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The body of a class contains zero or more *declarations*. These
*declarations* can include both stored and computed properties, instance
methods, class methods, initializers, a single destructor method, type
aliases, and even other class, structure, and enumeration declarations.
Class declarations can’t contain protocol declarations. For a discussion
and several examples of classes that include various kinds of
declarations, see [Classes and Structures](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml).

A class type can inherit from only one parent class, its *superclass*,
but can adopt any number of protocols. The *superclass* appears first in
the **type-inheritance-clause**, followed by any *adopted protocols*.

As discussed in [Initializer
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_625), classes can
have designated and convenience initializers. When you declare either
kind of initializer, you can require any subclass to override it by
marking the initializer with the required attribute. The
designated initializer of a class must initialize all of the class’s
declared properties and it must do so before calling any of its
superclass’s designated initializers.

A class can override properties, methods, and initializers of its
superclass. Overridden methods and properties must be marked with the
override keyword.

Although properties and methods declared in the *superclass* are
inherited by the current class, designated initializers declared in the
*superclass* are not. That said, if the current class overrides all of
the superclass’s designated initializers, it inherits the superclass’s
convenience initializers. Swift classes do not inherit from a universal
base class.

There are two ways create an instance of a previously declared class:

-   Call one of the initializers declared within the class, as described
    in [Initializers](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_269).

-   If no initializers are declared, and all properties of the class
    declaration were given initial values, call the class’s default
    initializer, as described in [Default
    Initializers](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_279).

Access properties of a class instance with dot (.)
syntax, as described in [Accessing
Properties](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_101).

Classes are reference types; instances of a class are referred to,
rather than copied, when assigned to variables or constants, or when
passed as arguments to a function call. For information about reference
types, see [Structures and Enumerations Are Value
Types](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH13-XID_104).

You can extend the behavior of a class type with an extension
declaration, as discussed in [Extension
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_633).

### Protocol Declaration 

A *protocol declaration* introduces a named protocol type into your
program. Protocol declarations are declared using the keyword
protocol and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    protocol protocol name: inherited protocols {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        protocol member declarations
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The body of a protocol contains zero or more *protocol member
declarations*, which describe the conformance requirements that any type
adopting the protocol must fulfill. In particular, a protocol can
declare that conforming types must implement certain properties,
methods, initializers, and subscripts. Protocols can also declare
special kinds of type aliases, called *associated types*, that can
specify relationships among the various declarations of the protocol.
The *protocol member declarations* are discussed in detail below.

Protocol types can inherit from any number of other protocols. When a
protocol type inherits from other protocols, the set of requirements
from those other protocols are aggregated, and any type that inherits
from the current protocol must conform to all those requirements. For an
example of how to use protocol inheritance, see [Protocol
Inheritance](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_360).

Note

You can also aggregate the conformance requirements of multiple
protocols using protocol composition types, as described in [Protocol
Composition Type](Types.xhtml#TP40014097-CH31-XID_1017) and [Protocol
Composition](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_361).

You can add protocol conformance to a previously declared type by
adopting the protocol in an extension declaration of that type. In the
extension, you must implement all of the adopted protocol’s
requirements. If the type already implements all of the requirements,
you can leave the body of the extension declaration empty.

By default, types that conform to a protocol must implement all
properties, methods, and subscripts declared in the protocol. That said,
you can mark these protocol member declarations with the
optional attribute to specify that their implementation
by a conforming type is optional. The optional attribute
can be applied only to protocols that are marked with the
objc attribute. As a result, only class types can adopt
and conform to a protocol that contains optional member requirements.
For more information about how to use the optional
attribute and for guidance about how to access optional protocol
members—for example, when you’re not sure whether a conforming type
implements them—see [Optional Protocol
Requirements](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_365).

To restrict the adoption of a protocol to class types only, mark the
entire protocol declaration with the class_protocol
attribute. Any protocol that inherits from a protocol marked with the
class_protocol attribute can likewise be adopted only by
a class type.

Note

If a protocol is already marked with the objc attribute,
the class_protocol attribute is implicitly applied to
that protocol; there’s no need to mark the protocol with the
class_protocol attribute explicitly.

Protocols are named types, and thus they can appear in all the same
places in your code as other named types, as discussed in [Protocols as
Types](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_352). However, you can’t
construct an instance of a protocol, because protocols do not actually
provide the implementations for the requirements they specify.

You can use protocols to declare which methods a delegate of a class or
structure should implement, as described in
[Delegation](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_354).

‌

### Protocol Property Declaration 

Protocols declare that conforming types must implement a property by
including a *protocol property declaration* in the body of the protocol
declaration. Protocol property declarations have a special form of a
variable declaration:

-   ~~~~ 
    var property name: type 
    ~~~~

As with other protocol member declarations, these property declarations
declare only the getter and setter requirements for types that conform
to the protocol. As a result, you don’t implement the getter or setter
directly in the protocol in which it is declared.

The getter and setter requirements can be satisfied by a conforming type
in a variety of ways. If a property declaration includes both the
get keywords, a conforming type
can implement it with a stored variable property or a computed property
that is both readable and writeable (that is, one that implements both a
getter and a setter). However, that property declaration can’t be
implemented as a constant property or a read-only computed property. If
a property declaration includes only the get keyword, it
can be implemented as any kind of property. For examples of conforming
types that implement the property requirements of a protocol, see
[Property Requirements](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_347).

See also [Variable
Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_512).

‌

### Protocol Method Declaration 

Protocols declare that conforming types must implement a method by
including a protocol method declaration in the body of the protocol
declaration. Protocol method declarations have the same form as function
declarations, with two exceptions: They don’t include a function body,
and you can’t provide any default parameter values as part of the
function declaration. For examples of conforming types that implement
the method requirements of a protocol, see [Method
Requirements](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_348).

To declare a class or static method requirement in a protocol
declaration, mark the method declaration with the class
keyword. Classes that implement this method also declare the method with
the class keyword. Structures that implement it must
declare the method with the static keyword instead. If
you’re implementing the method in an extension, use the
class keyword if you’re extending a class and the
static keyword if you’re extending a structure.

Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_545).

‌

### Protocol Initializer Declaration 

Protocols declare that conforming types must implement an initializer by
including a protocol initializer declaration in the body of the protocol
declaration. Protocol initializer declarations have the same form as
initializer declarations, except they don’t include the initializer’s
body.

Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_625).

‌

### Protocol Subscript Declaration 

Protocols declare that conforming types must implement a subscript by
including a protocol subscript declaration in the body of the protocol
declaration. Protocol property declarations have a special form of a
subscript declaration:

-   ~~~~ 
    subscript (parameters) -> return type 
    ~~~~

Subscript declarations only declare the minimum getter and setter
implementation requirements for types that conform to the protocol. If
the subscript declaration includes both the get and
set keywords, a conforming type must implement both a
getter and a setter clause. If the subscript declaration includes only
the get keyword, a conforming type must implement *at
least* a getter clause and optionally can implement a setter clause.

Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_637).

‌

### Protocol Associated Type Declaration 

Protocols declare associated types using the keyword
typealias. An associated type provides an alias for a
type that is used as part of a protocol’s declaration. Accosiated types
are similiar to type paramters in generic parameter clauses, but they’re
associated with Self in the protocol in which they’re
declared. In that context, Self refers to the eventual
type that conforms to the protocol. For more information and examples,
see [Associated Types](Generics.xhtml#TP40014097-CH26-XID_247).

Declaration](Declarations.xhtml#TP40014097-CH34-XID_539).

‌

### Initializer Declaration 

An *initializer declaration* introduces an initializer for a class,
structure, or enumeration into your program. Initializer declarations
are declared using the keyword init and have two basic
forms.

Structure, enumeration, and class types can have any number of
initializers, but the rules and associated behavior for class
initializers are different. Unlike structures and enumerations, classes
have two kinds of initializers: designated initializers and convenience
initializers, as described in [Initialization](Initialization.xhtml).

The following form declares initializers for structures, enumerations,
and designated initializers of classes:

-   ~~~~ 
    init(parameters) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

A designated initializer of a class initializes all of the class’s
properties directly. It can’t call any other initializers of the same
class, and if the class has a superclass, it must call one of the
superclass’s designated initializers. If the class inherits any
properties from its superclass, one of the superclass’s designated
initializers must be called before any of these properties can be set or
modified in the current class.

Designated initializers can be declared in the context of a class
declaration only and therefore can’t be added to a class using an
extension declaration.

Initializers in structures and enumerations can call other declared
initializers to delegate part or all of the initialization process.

To declare convenience initializers for a class, prefix the initializer
declaration with the context-sensitive keyword
convenience.

-   ~~~~ 
    convenience init(parameters) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

Convenience initializers can delegate the initialization process to
another convenience initializer or to one of the class’s designated
initializers. That said, the initialization processes must end with a
call to a designated initializer that ultimately initializes the class’s
properties. Convenience initializers can’t call a superclass’s
initializers.

You can mark designated and convenience initializers with the
required attribute to require that every subclass
implement the initializer. Because designated initializers are not
inherited by subclasses, they must be implemented directly. Required
convenience initializers can be either implemented explicitly or
inherited when the subclass directly implements all of the superclass’s
designated initializers (or overrides the designated initializers with
convenience initializers). Unlike methods, properties, and subscripts,
you don’t need to mark overridden initializers with the
override keyword.

To see examples of initializers in various type declarations, see
[Initialization](Initialization.xhtml).

‌ initializer-head →
[attributes](Attributes.xhtml#attributes)~opt~convenience

‌ initializer-body → [code-block](Declarations.xhtml#code-block)

‌

### Deinitializer Declaration 

A *deinitializer declaration* declares a deinitializer for a class type.
Deinitializers take no parameters and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    deinit {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

A deinitializer is called automatically when there are no longer any
references to a class object, just before the class object is
deallocated. A deinitializer can be declared only in the body of a class
declaration—but not in an extension of a class—and each class can have
at most one.

A subclass inherits its superclass’s deinitializer, which is implicitly
called just before the subclass object is deallocated. The subclass
object is not deallocated until all deinitializers in its inheritance
chain have finished executing.

Deinitializers are not called directly.

For an example of how to use a deinitializer in a class declaration, see
[Deinitialization](Deinitialization.xhtml).

[attributes](Attributes.xhtml#attributes)~opt~deinit[code-block](Declarations.xhtml#code-block)

‌

### Extension Declaration 

An *extension declaration* allows you to extend the behavior of existing
class, structure, and enumeration types. Extension declarations begin
with the keyword extension and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    extension type: adopted protocols {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        declarations
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

The body of an extension declaration contains zero or more
*declarations*. These *declarations* can include computed properties,
computed static properties, instance methods, static and class methods,
initializers, subscript declarations, and even class, structure, and
enumeration declarations. Extension declarations can’t contain
destructor or protocol declarations, store properties, property
observers, or other extension declarations. For a discussion and several
examples of extensions that include various kinds of declarations, see
[Extensions](Extensions.xhtml).

Extension declarations can add protocol conformance to an existing
class, structure, and enumeration type in the *adopted protocols*.
Extension declarations can’t add class inheritance to an existing class,
and therefore the **type-inheritance-clause** in an extension
declaration contains only a list of protocols.

Properties, methods, and initializers of an existing type can’t be
overridden in an extension of that type.

Extension declarations can contain initializer declarations. That said,
if the type you’re extending is defined in another module, an
initializer declaration must delegate to an initializer already defined
in that module to ensure members of that type are properly initialized.

‌

### Subscript Declaration 

A *subscript* declaration allows you to add subscripting support for
objects of a particular type and are typically used to provide a
convenient syntax for accessing the elements in a collection, list, or
sequence. Subscript declarations are declared using the keyword
subscript and have the following form:

-   ~~~~ 
    subscript (parameters) -> return type {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        get {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
            statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        set(setter name) {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
            statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        }
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

Subscript declarations can appear only in the context of a class,
structure, enumeration, extension, or protocol declaration.

The *parameters* specify one or more indexes used to access elements of
the corresponding type in a subscript expression (for example, the
i). Although
the indexes used to access the elements can be of any type, each
parameter must include a type annotation to specify the type of each
index. The *return type* specifies the type of the element being
accessed.

As with computed properties, subscript declarations support reading and
writing the value of the accessed elements. The getter is used to read
the value, and the setter is used to write the value. The setter clause
is optional, and when only a getter is needed, you can omit both clauses
and simply return the requested value directly. That said, if you
provide a setter clause, you must also provide a getter clause.

The *setter name* and enclosing parentheses are optional. If you provide
a setter name, it is used as the name of the parameter to the setter. If
you do not provide a setter name, the default parameter name to the
setter is value. That type of the *setter name* must be
the same as the *return type*.

You can overload a subscript declaration in the type in which it is
declared, as long as the *parameters* or the *return type* differ from
the one you’re overloading. You can also override a subscript
declaration inherited from a superclass. When you do so, you must mark
the overridden subscript declaration with the override
keyword.

You can also declare subscripts in the context of a protocol

### Operator Declaration 

An *operator declaration* introduces a new infix, prefix, or postfix
operator into your program and is declared using the contextual keyword
operator.

You can declare operators of three different fixities: infix, prefix,
and postfix. The *fixity* of an operator specifies the relative position
of an operator to its operands.

There are three basic forms of an operator declaration, one for each
fixity. The fixity of the operator is specified by including the
contextual keyword infix, or
postfix and the name of
the operator. In each form, the name of the operator can contain only
the operator characters defined in
[Operators](LexicalStructure.xhtml#TP40014097-CH30-XID_871).

The following form declares a new infix operator:

-   ~~~~ 
    operator infix operator name {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        precedence precedence level
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        associativity associativity
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

An *infix operator* is a binary operator that is written between its two
operands, such as the familiar addition operator (+) in
the expression 1 + 2.

Infix operators can optionally specify a precedence, associativity, or
both.

The *precedence* of an operator specifies how tightly an operator binds
to its operands in the absence of grouping parentheses. You specify the
precedence of an operator by writing the contextual keyword
precedence followed by the *precedence level*. The
*precedence level* can be any whole number (decimal integer) from 0 to
255; unlike decimal integer literals, it can’t contain any underscore
characters. Although the precedence level is a specific number, it is
significant only relative to another operator. That is, when two
operators compete with each other for their operands, such as in the
expression 2 + 3 * 5, the operator with the higher
precedence level binds more tightly to its operands.

The *associativity* of an operator specifies how a sequence of operators
with the same precedence level are grouped together in the absence of
grouping parentheses. You specify the associativity of an operator by
writing the contextual keyword associativity followed by
the *associativity*, which is one of the contextual keywords
left.
Operators that are left-associative group left-to-right. For example,
the subtraction operator (-) is left-associative, and
therefore the expression 4 - 5 - 6 is grouped as
(4 - 5) - 6. Operators
that are right-associative group right-to-left, and operators that are
specified with an associativity of none don’t associate
at all. Nonassociative operators of the same precedence level can’t
appear adjacent to each to other. For example, 1 < 2 < 3
is not a valid expression.

Infix operators that are declared without specifying a precedence or
associativity are initialized with a precedence level of 100 and an
associativity of none.

The following form declares a new prefix operator:

-   ~~~~ 
    operator prefix operator name 
    ~~~~

A *prefix operator* is a unary operator that is written immediately
before its operand, such as the prefix increment operator
(++.

Prefix operators declarations don’t specify a precedence level. Prefix
operators are nonassociative.

The following form declares a new postfix operator:

-   ~~~~ 
    operator postfix operator name 
    ~~~~

A *postfix operator* is a unary operator that is written immediately
after its operand, such as the postfix increment operator
(++.

As with prefix operators, postfix operator declarations don’t specify a
precedence level. Postfix operators are nonassociative.

After declaring a new operator, you implement it by declaring a function
that has the same name as the operator. To see an example of how to
create and implement a new operator, see [Custom
Operators](AdvancedOperators.xhtml#TP40014097-CH27-XID_48).
