The Basics 
----------

Swift is a new programming language for iOS and OS X app development.
Nonetheless, many parts of Swift will be familiar from your experience
of developing in C and Objective-C.

Swift provides its own versions of all fundamental C and Objective-C
types, including Int
and Float
for Boolean values; and String for textual data. Swift
also provides powerful versions of the two primary collection types,
Array, as described in
[Collection Types](CollectionTypes.xhtml).

Like C, Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an
identifying name. Swift also makes extensive use of variables whose
values cannot be changed. These are known as constants, and are much
more powerful than constants in C. Constants are used throughout Swift
to make code safer and clearer in intent when you work with values that
do not need to change.

In addition to familiar types, Swift introduces advanced types not found
in Objective-C. These include tuples, which enable you to create and
pass around groupings of values. Tuples can return multiple values from
a function as a single compound value.

Swift also introduces optional types, which handle the absence of a
value. Optionals say either ‚Äúthere *is* a value, and it equals *x*‚Äù or
‚Äúthere *isn‚Äôt* a value at all‚Äù. Optionals are similar to using
nil with pointers in Objective-C, but they work for any
type, not just classes. Optionals are safer and more expressive than
nil pointers in Objective-C and are at the heart of many
of Swift‚Äôs most powerful features.

Optionals are an example of the fact that Swift is a *type safe*
language. Swift helps you to be clear about the types of values your
code can work with. If part of your code expects a
String, type safety prevents you from passing it an
Int by mistake. This enables you to catch and fix errors
as early as possible in the development process.

‚Äå

### Constants and Variables 

Constants and variables associate a name (such as
maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts or
welcomeMessage) with a value of a particular type (such
as the number 10).
The value of a *constant* cannot be changed once it is set, whereas a
*variable* can be set to a different value in the future.

‚Äå

### Declaring Constants and Variables 

Constants and variables must be declared before they are used. You
declare constants with the let keyword and variables with
the var keyword. Here‚Äôs an example of how constants and
variables can be used to track the number of login attempts a user has
made:

    let
    var

This code can be read as:

‚ÄúDeclare a new constant called
maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts, and give it a value of
10. Then, declare a new variable called
currentLoginAttempt, and give it an initial value of
0.‚Äù

In this example, the maximum number of allowed login attempts is
declared as a constant, because the maximum value never changes. The
current login attempt counter is declared as a variable, because this
value must be incremented after each failed login attempt.

You can declare multiple constants or multiple variables on a single
line, separated by commas:

    var,
    z

Note

If a stored value in your code is not going to change, always declare it
as a constant with the let keyword. Use variables only
for storing values that need to be able to change.

‚Äå

### Type Annotations 

You can provide a *type annotation* when you declare a constant or
variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable
can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant
or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type
to use.

This example provides a type annotation for a variable called
welcomeMessage, to indicate that the variable can store
String values:

    var

The colon in the declaration means *‚Äú‚Ä¶of type‚Ä¶,‚Äù* so the code above can
be read as:

‚ÄúDeclare a variable called welcomeMessage that is of type
String.‚Äù

The phrase ‚Äúof type String‚Äù means ‚Äúcan store any
String value.‚Äù Think of it as meaning ‚Äúthe type of thing‚Äù
(or ‚Äúthe kind of thing‚Äù) that can be stored.

The welcomeMessage variable can now be set to any string
value without error:

    welcomeMessage

Note

It is rare that you need to write type annotations in practice. If you
provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it
is defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that
constant or variable, as described in [Type Safety and Type
Inference](TheBasics.xhtml#TP40014097-CH5-XID_418). In the
welcomeMessage example above, no initial value is
provided, and so the type of the welcomeMessage variable
is specified with a type annotation rather than being inferred from an
initial value.

‚Äå

### Naming Constants and Variables 

You can use almost any character you like for constant and variable
names, including Unicode characters:

    let
    let
    let

Constant and variable names cannot contain mathematical symbols, arrows,
private-use (or invalid) Unicode code points, or line- and box-drawing
characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be
included elsewhere within the name.

Once you‚Äôve declared a constant or variable of a certain type, you can‚Äôt
redeclare it again with the same name, or change it to store values of a
different type. Nor can you change a constant into a variable or a
variable into a constant.

Note

If you need to give a constant or variable the same name as a reserved
Swift keyword, you can do so by surrounding the keyword with back ticks
(  ) when using it as a name. However, you should
avoid using keywords as names unless you have absolutely no choice.

You can change the value of an existing variable to another value of a
compatible type. In this example, the value of
friendlyWelcome
to "Bonjour!":

    var
    friendlyWelcome
    // friendlyWelcome is now "Bonjour!"

Unlike a variable, the value of a constant cannot be changed once it is
set. Attempting to do so is reported as an error when your code is
compiled:

    let
    languageName
    // this is a compile-time error - languageName cannot be changed

‚Äå

### Printing Constants and Variables 

You can print the current value of a constant or variable with the
println function:

    println)
    // prints "Bonjour!"

println is a global function that prints a value,
followed by a line break, to an appropriate output. If you are working
in Xcode, for example, println prints its output in
Xcode‚Äôs ‚Äúconsole‚Äù pane. (A second function, print,
performs the same task without appending a line break to the end of the
value to be printed.)

The println
value you pass to it:

    println)
    // prints "This is a string"

The println function can print more complex logging
messages, in a similar manner to Cocoa‚Äôs NSLog function.
These messages can include the current values of constants and
variables.

Swift uses *string interpolation* to include the name of a constant or
variable as a placeholder in a longer string, and to prompt Swift to
replace it with the current value of that constant or variable. Wrap the
name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the opening
parenthesis:

    println)
    // prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"

Note

All options you can use with string interpolation are described in
[String
Interpolation](StringsAndCharacters.xhtml#TP40014097-CH7-XID_381).

‚Äå

### Comments 

Use comments to include non-executable text in your code, as a note or
reminder to yourself. Comments are ignored by the Swift compiler when
your code is compiled.

Comments in Swift are very similar to comments in C. Single-line
comments begin with two forward-slashes (//):

    // this is a comment

You can also write multiline comments, which start with a forward-slash
followed by an asterisk (/*) and end with an asterisk
followed by a forward-slash (*/):

    /* this is also a comment,
    but written over multiple lines */

Unlike multiline comments in C, multiline comments in Swift can be
nested inside other multiline comments. You write nested comments by
starting a multiline comment block and then starting a second multiline
comment within the first block. The second block is then closed,
followed by the first block:

    /* this is the start of the first multiline comment
    /* this is the second, nested multiline comment */
    this is the end of the first multiline comment */

Nested multiline comments enable you to comment out large blocks of code
quickly and easily, even if the code already contains multiline
comments.

‚Äå

### Semicolons 

Unlike many other languages, Swift does not require you to write a
semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, although
you can do so if you wish. Semicolons *are* required, however, if you
want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:

    let;
    println)
    // prints "üê±"

‚Äå

### Integers 

*Integers* are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as
42. Integers are either *signed*
(positive, zero, or negative) or *unsigned* (positive or zero).

Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit
forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that
an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit
signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift,
these integer types have capitalized names.

‚Äå

### Integer Bounds 

You can access the minimum and maximum values of each integer type with
its min properties:

    let
    // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
    let
    // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8

The values of these properties are of the appropriate-sized number type
(such as UInt8 in the example above) and can therefore be
used in expressions alongside other values of the same type.

‚Äå

### Int 

In most cases, you don‚Äôt need to pick a specific size of integer to use
in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type,
Int, which has the same size as the current platform‚Äôs
native word size:

-   On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same size as
    Int32.

-   On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same size as
    Int64.

Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use
Int for integer values in your code. This aids code
consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms,
Int can store any value between
-2,147,483,648, and is
large enough for many integer ranges.

‚Äå

### UInt 

Swift also provides an unsigned integer type, UInt, which
has the same size as the current platform‚Äôs native word size:

-   On a 32-bit platform, UInt is the same size as
    UInt32.

-   On a 64-bit platform, UInt is the same size as
    UInt64.

Note

Use UInt only when you specifically need an unsigned
integer type with the same size as the platform‚Äôs native word size. If
this is not the case, Int is preferred, even when the
values to be stored are known to be non-negative. A consistent use of
Int for integer values aids code interoperability, avoids
the need to convert between different number types, and matches integer
type inference, as described in [Type Safety and Type
Inference](TheBasics.xhtml#TP40014097-CH5-XID_418).

‚Äå

### Floating-Point Numbers 

*Floating-point numbers* are numbers with a fractional component, such
as 3.14159, and
-273.15.

Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than
integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller
than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed
floating-point number types:

    Double represents a 64-bit floating-point number. Use
    it when floating-point values must be very large or particularly
    precise.

    Float represents a 32-bit floating-point number. Use
    it when floating-point values do not require 64-bit precision.

Note

Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits,
whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6
decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on
the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code.

‚Äå

### Type Safety and Type Inference 

Swift is a *type safe* language. A type safe language encourages you to
be clear about the types of values your code can work with. If part of
your code expects a String, you can‚Äôt pass it an
Int by mistake.

Because Swift is type safe, it performs *type checks* when compiling
your code and flags any mismatched types as errors. This enables you to
catch and fix errors as early as possible in the development process.

Type-checking helps you avoid errors when you‚Äôre working with different
types of values. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to specify the
type of every constant and variable that you declare. If you don‚Äôt
specify the type of value you need, Swift uses *type inference* to work
out the appropriate type. Type inference enables a compiler to deduce
the type of a particular expression automatically when it compiles your
code, simply by examining the values you provide.

Because of type inference, Swift requires far fewer type declarations
than languages such as C or Objective-C. Constants and variables are
still explicitly typed, but much of the work of specifying their type is
done for you.

Type inference is particularly useful when you declare a constant or
variable with an initial value. This is often done by assigning a
*literal value* (or *literal*) to the constant or variable at the point
that you declare it. (A literal value is a value that appears directly
in your source code, such as 42 and
3.14159 in the examples below.)

For example, if you assign a literal value of 42 to a new
constant without saying what type it is, Swift infers that you want the
constant to be an Int, because you have initialized it
with a number that looks like an integer:

    let
    // meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int

Likewise, if you don‚Äôt specify a type for a floating-point literal,
Swift infers that you want to create a Double:

    let
    // pi is inferred to be of type Double

Swift always chooses Double (rather than
Float) when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.

If you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression, a
type of Double will be inferred from the context:

    let
    // anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double

The literal value of 3 has no explicit type in and of
itself, and so an appropriate output type of Double is
inferred from the presence of a floating-point literal as part of the
addition.

‚Äå

### Numeric Literals 

Integer literals can be written as:

-   A *decimal* number, with no prefix

-   A *binary* number, with a 0b prefix

-   An *octal* number, with a 0o prefix

-   A *hexadecimal* number, with a 0x prefix

All of these integer literals have a decimal value of 17:

    let
    let
    // 17 in binary notation
    let
    // 17 in octal notation
    let
    // 17 in hexadecimal notation

Floating-point literals can be decimal (with no prefix), or hexadecimal
(with a 0x prefix). They must always have a number (or
hexadecimal number) on both sides of the decimal point. They can also
have an optional *exponent*, indicated by an uppercase or lowercase
e for decimal floats, or an uppercase or lowercase
p for hexadecimal floats.

For decimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base
number is multiplied by 10^exp^:

    1.25e2.

    1.25e-2 means 1.25 √ó 10^-2^, or
    0.0125.

For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of exp, the base
number is multiplied by 2^exp^:

    0xFp2.

    0xFp-2.

All of these floating-point literals have a decimal value of
12.1875:

    let
    let
    let

Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to
read. Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeroes and can
contain underscores to help with readability. Neither type of formatting
affects the underlying value of the literal:

    let
    let
    let =
    1_000_000.000_000_1

‚Äå

### Numeric Type Conversion 

Use the Int type for all general-purpose integer
constants and variables in your code, even if they are known to be
non-negative. Using the default integer type in everyday situations
means that integer constants and variables are immediately interoperable
in your code and will match the inferred type for integer literal
values.

Use other integer types only when they are are specifically needed for
the task at hand, because of explicitly-sized data from an external
source, or for performance, memory usage, or other necessary
optimization. Using explicitly-sized types in these situations helps to
catch any accidental value overflows and implicitly documents the nature
of the data being used.

‚Äå

### Integer Conversion 

The range of numbers that can be stored in an integer constant or
variable is different for each numeric type. An Int8
constant or variable can store numbers between -128 and
127 constant or variable
can store numbers between 0. A
number that will not fit into a constant or variable of a sized integer
type is reported as an error when your code is compiled:

    let
    // UInt8 cannot store negative numbers, and so this will report an error
    let =
    Int8
    // Int8 cannot store a number larger than its maximum value,
    // and so this will also report an error

Because each numeric type can store a different range of values, you
must opt in to numeric type conversion on a case-by-case basis. This
opt-in approach prevents hidden conversion errors and helps make type
conversion intentions explicit in your code.

To convert one specific number type to another, you initialize a new
number of the desired type with the existing value. In the example
below, the constant twoThousand is of type
UInt16 is of
type UInt8. They cannot be added together directly,
because they are not of the same type. Instead, this example calls
UInt16(one)
initialized with the value of one, and uses this value in
place of the original:

    let
    let
    let +
    UInt16)

Because both sides of the addition are now of type
UInt16, the addition is allowed. The output constant
(twoThousandAndOne) is inferred to be of type
UInt16, because it is the sum of two
UInt16 values.

SomeType(ofInitialValue) is the default way to call the
initializer of a Swift type and pass in an initial value. Behind the
scenes, UInt16 has an initializer that accepts a
UInt8 value, and so this initializer is used to make a
new UInt16. You
can‚Äôt pass in *any* type here, however‚Äîit has to be a type for which
UInt16 provides an initializer. Extending existing types
to provide initializers that accept new types (including your own type
definitions) is covered in [Extensions](Extensions.xhtml).

‚Äå

### Integer and Floating-Point Conversion 

Conversions between integer and floating-point numeric types must be
made explicit:

    let
    let
    let) +
    pointOneFourOneFiveNine
    // pi equals 3.14159, and is inferred to be of type Double

Here, the value of the constant three is used to create a
new value of type Double, so that both sides of the
addition are of the same type. Without this conversion in place, the
addition would not be allowed.

The reverse is also true for floating-point to integer conversion, in
that an integer type can be initialized with a Double or
Float value:

    let)
    // integerPi equals 3, and is inferred to be of type Int

Floating-point values are always truncated when used to initialize a new
integer value in this way. This means that 4.75 becomes
4.

Note

The rules for combining numeric constants and variables are different
from the rules for numeric literals. The literal value 3
can be added directly to the literal value 0.14159,
because number literals do not have an explicit type in and of
themselves. Their type is inferred only at the point that they are
evaluated by the compiler.

‚Äå

### Type Aliases 

*Type aliases* define an alternative name for an existing type. You
define type aliases with the typealias keyword.

Type aliases are useful when you want to refer to an existing type by a
name that is contextually more appropriate, such as when working with
data of a specific size from an external source:

    typealias

Once you define a type alias, you can use the alias anywhere you might
use the original name:

    var =
    AudioSample
    // maxAmplitudeFound is now 0

Here, AudioSample is defined as an alias for
UInt16. Because it is an alias, the call to
AudioSample.min,
which provides an initial value of 0 for the
maxAmplitudeFound variable.

‚Äå

### Booleans 

Swift has a basic *Boolean* type, called Bool. Boolean
values are referred to as *logical*, because they can only ever be true
or false. Swift provides two Boolean constant values,
true:

    let
    let

The types of orangesAreOrange and
turnipsAreDelicious have been inferred as
Bool from the fact that they were initialized with
Boolean literal values. As with Int and
Double above, you don‚Äôt need to declare constants or
variables as Bool
or false as soon as you create them. Type inference helps
make Swift code more concise and readable when it initializes constants
or variables with other values whose type is already known.

Boolean values are particularly useful when you work with conditional
statements such as the if statement:

    if {
        println)
    } else {
        println)
    }
    // prints "Eww, turnips are horrible."

Conditional statements such as the if statement are
covered in more detail in [Control Flow](ControlFlow.xhtml).

Swift‚Äôs type safety prevents non-Boolean values from being be
substituted for Bool. The following example reports a
compile-time error:

    let
    if {
        // this example will not compile, and will report an error
    }

However, the alternative example below is valid:

    let
    if {
        // this example will compile successfully
    }

The result of the i == 1 comparison is of type
Bool, and so this second example passes the type-check.
Comparisons like i == 1 are discussed in [Basic
Operators](BasicOperators.xhtml).

As with other examples of type safety in Swift, this approach avoids
accidental errors and ensures that the intention of a particular section
of code is always clear.

‚Äå

### Tuples 

*Tuples* group multiple values into a single compound value. The values
within a tuple can be of any type and do not have to be of the same type
as each other.

In this example, (404, "Not Found") is a tuple that
describes an *HTTP status code*. An HTTP status code is a special value
returned by a web server whenever you request a web page. A status code
of 404 Not Found is returned if you request a webpage
that doesn‚Äôt exist.

    let,
    "Not Found")
    // http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")

The (404, "Not Found") tuple groups together an
Int to give the HTTP status
code two separate values: a number and a human-readable description. It
can be described as ‚Äúa tuple of type (Int, String)‚Äù.

You can create tuples from any permutation of types, and they can
contain as many different types as you like. There‚Äôs nothing stopping
you from having a tuple of type (Int, Int, Int), or
(String, Bool), or indeed any other permutation you
require.

You can *decompose* a tuple‚Äôs contents into separate constants or
variables, which you then access as usual:

    let) =
    http404Error
    println)
    // prints "The status code is 404"
    println)
    // prints "The status message is Not Found"

If you only need some of the tuple‚Äôs values, ignore parts of the tuple
with an underscore (_) when you decompose the tuple:

    let) =
    http404Error
    println)
    // prints "The status code is 404"

Alternatively, access the individual element values in a tuple using
index numbers starting at zero:

    println)
    // prints "The status code is 404"
    println)
    // prints "The status message is Not Found"

You can name the individual elements in a tuple when the tuple is
defined:

    let:
    200)

If you name the elements in a tuple, you can use the element names to
access the values of those elements:

    println)
    // prints "The status code is 200"
    println)
    // prints "The status message is OK"

Tuples are particularly useful as the return values of functions. A
function that tries to retrieve a web page might return the
(Int, String) tuple type to describe the success or
failure of the page retrieval. By returning a tuple with two distinct
values, each of a different type, the function provides more useful
information about its outcome than if it could only return a single
value of a single type. For more information, see [Functions with
Multiple Return Values](Functions.xhtml#TP40014097-CH10-XID_212).

Note

Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values. They are not
suited to the creation of complex data structures. If your data
structure is likely to persist beyond a temporary scope, model it as a
class or structure, rather than as a tuple. For more information, see
[Classes and Structures](ClassesAndStructures.xhtml).

‚Äå

### Optionals 

You use *optionals* in situations where a value may be absent. An
optional says:

-   There *is* a value, and it equals *x*

*or*

-   There *isn‚Äôt* a value at all

Note

The concept of optionals doesn‚Äôt exist in C or Objective-C. The nearest
thing in Objective-C is the ability to return nil from a
method that would otherwise return an object, with nil
meaning ‚Äúthe absence of a valid object.‚Äù However, this only works for
objects‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt work for structs, basic C types, or enumeration
values. For these types, Objective-C methods typically return a special
value (such as NSNotFound) to indicate the absence of a
value. This approach assumes that the method‚Äôs caller knows there is a
special value to test against and remembers to check for it. Swift‚Äôs
optionals let you indicate the absence of a value for *any type at all*,
without the need for special constants.

Here‚Äôs an example. Swift‚Äôs String type has a method
called toInt, which tries to convert a
String value. However,
not every string can be converted into an integer. The string
"123" can be converted into the numeric value
123 does
not have an obvious numeric value to convert to.

The example below uses the toInt method to try to convert
a String:

    let
    let =
    possibleNumber()
    // convertedNumber is inferred to be of type "Int?", or "optional Int"

Because the toInt method might fail, it returns an
*optional* Int. An
optional Int, not
Int. The question mark indicates that the value it
contains is optional, meaning that it might contain *some*
Int value, or it might contain *no value at all*. (It
can‚Äôt contain anything else, such as a Bool value or a
String, or it‚Äôs
nothing at all.)

‚Äå

### If Statements and Forced Unwrapping 

You can use an if statement to find out whether an
optional contains a value. If an optional does have a value, it
evaluates to true; if it has no value at all, it
evaluates to false.

Once you‚Äôre sure that the optional *does* contain a value, you can
access its underlying value by adding an exclamation mark
(!) to the end of the optional‚Äôs name. The exclamation
mark effectively says, ‚ÄúI know that this optional definitely has a
value; please use it.‚Äù This is known as *forced unwrapping* of the
optional‚Äôs value:

    if {
        println)
    } else {
        println)
    }
    // prints "123 has an integer value of 123"

For more on the if statement, see [Control
Flow](ControlFlow.xhtml).

Note

Trying to use ! to access a non-existent optional value
triggers a runtime error. Always make sure that an optional contains a
non-nil to
force-unwrap its value.

‚Äå

### Optional Binding 

You use *optional binding* to find out whether an optional contains a
value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary constant
or variable. Optional binding can be used with if and
while statements to check for a value inside an optional,
and to extract that value into a constant or variable, as part of a
single action. if statements are
described in more detail in [Control Flow](ControlFlow.xhtml).

Write optional bindings for the if statement as follows:

-   ~~~~ 
    if let constantName = someOptional {
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
        statements
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    }
    ~~~~

You can rewrite the possibleNumber example from above to
use optional binding rather than forced unwrapping:

    if =
    possibleNumber() {
        println)
    } else {
        println)
    }
    // prints "123 has an integer value of 123"

This can be read as:

‚ÄúIf the optional Int returned by
possibleNumber.toInt contains a value, set a new constant
called actualNumber to the value contained in the
optional.‚Äù

If the conversion is successful, the actualNumber
constant becomes available for use within the first branch of the
if statement. It has already been initialized with the
value contained *within* the optional, and so there is no need to use
the ! suffix to access its value. In this example,
actualNumber is simply used to print the result of the
conversion.

You can use both constants and variables with optional binding. If you
wanted to manipulate the value of actualNumber within the
first branch of the if statement, you could write
if var actualNumber instead, and the value contained
within the optional would be made available as a variable rather than a
constant.

### nil 

You set an optional variable to a valueless state by assigning it the
special value nil:

    var
    // serverResponseCode contains an actual Int value of 404
    serverResponseCode
    // serverResponseCode now contains no value

Note

nil cannot be used with non-optional constants and
variables. If a constant or variable in your code needs to be able to
cope with the absence of a value under certain conditions, always
declare it as an optional value of the appropriate type.

If you define an optional constant or variable without providing a
default value, the constant or variable is automatically set to
nil for you:

    var?
    // surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil

Note

Swift‚Äôs nil in
Objective-C. In Objective-C, nil is a pointer to a
non-existent object. In Swift, nil is not a pointer‚Äîit is
the absence of a value of a certain type. Optionals of *any* type can be
set to nil, not just object types.

‚Äå

### Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals 

As described above, optionals indicate that a constant or variable is
allowed to have ‚Äúno value‚Äù. Optionals can be checked with an
if statement to see if a value exists, and can be
conditionally unwrapped with optional binding to access the optional‚Äôs
value if it does exist.

Sometimes it is clear from a program‚Äôs structure that an optional will
*always* have a value, after that value is first set. In these cases, it
is useful to remove the need to check and unwrap the optional‚Äôs value
every time it is accessed, because it can be safely assumed to have a
value all of the time.

These kinds of optionals are defined as *implicitly unwrapped
optionals*. You write an implicitly unwrapped optional by placing an
exclamation mark (String!) rather than a question mark
(String?) after the type that you want to make optional.

Implicitly unwrapped optionals are useful when an optional‚Äôs value is
confirmed to exist immediately after the optional is first defined and
can definitely be assumed to exist at every point thereafter. The
primary use of implicitly unwrapped optionals in Swift is during class
initialization, as described in [Unowned References and Implicitly
Unwrapped Optional
Properties](AutomaticReferenceCounting.xhtml#TP40014097-CH20-XID_60).

An implicitly unwrapped optional is a normal optional behind the scenes,
but can also be used like a nonoptional value, without the need to
unwrap the optional value each time it is accessed. The following
example shows the difference in behavior between an optional
String and an implicitly unwrapped optional
String:

    let? =
    "An optional string."
    println!)
    // requires an exclamation mark to access its value
    // prints "An optional string."
     
    let! =
    "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."
    println)
    // no exclamation mark is needed to access its value
    // prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."

You can think of an implicitly unwrapped optional as giving permission
for the optional to be unwrapped automatically whenever it is used.
Rather than placing an exclamation mark after the optional‚Äôs name each
time you use it, you place an exclamation mark after the optional‚Äôs type
when you declare it.

Note

If you try to access an implicitly unwrapped optional when it does not
contain a value, you will trigger a runtime error. The result is exactly
the same as if you place an exclamation mark after a normal optional
that does not contain a value.

You can still treat an implicitly unwrapped optional like a normal
optional, to check if it contains a value:

    if {
        println)
    }
    // prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."

You can also use an implicitly unwrapped optional with optional binding,
to check and unwrap its value in a single statement:

    if =
    assumedString {
        println)
    }
    // prints "An implicitly unwrapped optional string."

Note

Implicitly unwrapped optionals should not be used when there is a
possibility of a variable becoming nil at a later point.
Always use a normal optional type if you need to check for a
nil value during the lifetime of a variable.

### Assertions 

Optionals enable you to check for values that may or may not exist, and
to write code that copes gracefully with the absence of a value. In some
cases, however, it is simply not possible for your code to continue
execution if a value does not exist, or if a provided value does not
satisfy certain conditions. In these situations, you can trigger an
*assertion* in your code to end code execution and to provide an
opportunity to debug the cause of the absent or invalid value.

‚Äå

### Debugging with Assertions 

An assertion is a runtime check that a logical condition definitely
evaluates to true. Literally put, an assertion ‚Äúasserts‚Äù
that a condition is true. You use an assertion to make sure that an
essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If
the condition evaluates to true, code execution continues
as usual; if the condition evaluates to false, code
execution ends, and your app is terminated.

If your code triggers an assertion while running in a debug environment,
such as when you build and run an app in Xcode, you can see exactly
where the invalid state occurred and query the state of your app at the
time that the assertion was triggered. An assertion also lets you
provide a suitable debug message as to the nature of the assert.

You write an assertion by calling the global assert
function. You pass the assert function an expression that
evaluates to true and a message
that should be displayed if the result of the condition is
false:

    let
    assert,
    "A person's age cannot be less than zero")
    // this causes the assertion to trigger, because age is not >= 0

In this example, code execution will continue only if
age >= 0, that is, if
the value of age is non-negative. If the value of
age *is* negative, as in the code above, then
age >= 0, and the
assertion is triggered, terminating the application.

Assertion messages cannot use string interpolation. The assertion
message can be omitted if desired, as in the following example:

    assert)

‚Äå

### When to Use Assertions 

Use an assertion whenever a condition has the potential to be false, but
must *definitely* be true in order for your code to continue execution.
Suitable scenarios for an assertion check include:

-   An integer subscript index is passed to a custom subscript
    implementation, but the subscript index value could be too low or
    too high.

-   A value is passed to a function, but an invalid value means that the
    function cannot fulfill its task.

-   An optional value is currently nil, but a
    non-nil value is essential for subsequent code to
    execute successfully.

See also [Subscripts](Subscripts.xhtml) and
[Functions](Functions.xhtml).

Note

Assertions cause your app to terminate and are not a substitute for
designing your code in such a way that invalid conditions are unlikely
to arise. Nonetheless, in situations where invalid conditions are
possible, an assertion is an effective way to ensure that such
conditions are highlighted and noticed during development, before your
app is published.
