Properties 
----------

*Properties* associate values with a particular class, structure, or
enumeration. Stored properties store constant and variable values as
part of an instance, whereas computed properties calculate (rather than
store) a value. Computed properties are provided by classes, structures,
and enumerations. Stored properties are provided only by classes and
structures.

Stored and computed properties are usually associated with instances of
a particular type. However, properties can also be associated with the
type itself. Such properties are known as type properties.

In addition, you can define property observers to monitor changes in a
property’s value, which you can respond to with custom actions. Property
observers can be added to stored properties you define yourself, and
also to properties that a subclass inherits from its superclass.

‌

### Stored Properties 

In its simplest form, a stored property is a constant or variable that
is stored as part of an instance of a particular class or structure.
Stored properties can be either *variable stored properties* (introduced
by the var keyword) or *constant stored properties*
(introduced by the let keyword).

You can provide a default value for a stored property as part of its
definition, as described in [Default Property
Values](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_270). You can also set
and modify the initial value for a stored property during
initialization. This is true even for constant stored properties, as
described in [Modifying Constant Properties During
Initialization](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_277).

The example below defines a structure called
FixedLengthRange, which describes a range of integers
whose range length cannot be changed once it is created:

    struct {
        var
        let
    }
    var =
    FixedLengthRange:
    3)
    // the range represents integer values 0, 1, and 2
    rangeOfThreeItems
    // the range now represents integer values 6, 7, and 8

Instances of FixedLengthRange have a variable stored
property called firstValue and a constant stored property
called length. In the example above,
length is initialized when the new range is created and
cannot be changed thereafter, because it is a constant property.

‌

### Stored Properties of Constant Structure Instances 

If you create an instance of a structure and assign that instance to a
constant, you cannot modify the instance’s properties, even if they were
declared as variable properties:

    let =
    FixedLengthRange:
    4)
    // this range represents integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3
    rangeOfFourItems
    // this will report an error, even thought firstValue is a variable property

Because rangeOfFourItems is declared as a constant (with
the let keyword), it is not possible to change its
firstValue property, even though
firstValue is a variable property.

This behavior is due to structures being *value types*. When an instance
of a value type is marked as a constant, so are all of its properties.

The same is not true for classes, which are *reference types*. If you
assign an instance of a reference type to a constant, you can still
change that instance’s variable properties.

‌

### Lazy Stored Properties 

A *lazy stored property* is a property whose initial value is not
calculated until the first time it is used. You indicate a lazy stored
property by writing the @lazy attribute before its
declaration.

Note

You must always declare a lazy property as a variable (with the
var keyword), because its initial value may not be
retrieved until after instance initialization completes. Constant
properties must always have a value *before* initialization completes,
and therefore cannot be declared as lazy.

Lazy properties are useful when the initial value for a property is
dependent on outside factors whose values are not known until after an
instance’s initialization is complete. Lazy properties are also useful
when the initial value for a property requires complex or
computationally expensive setup that should not be performed unless or
until it is needed.

The example below uses a lazy stored property to avoid unnecessary
initialization of a complex class. This example defines two classes
called DataImporter,
neither of which is shown in full:

    class {
        /*
        DataImporter is a class to import data from an external file.
        The class is assumed to take a non-trivial amount of time to initialize.
        */
        var
        // the DataImporter class would provide data importing functionality here
    }
     
    class {
        @lazy =
    DataImporter()
        var[]()
        // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
    }
     
    let()
    manager
    manager
    // the DataImporter instance for the importer property has not yet been created

The DataManager class has a stored property called
data, which is initialized with a new, empty array of
String values. Although the rest of its functionality is
not shown, the purpose of this DataManager class is to
manage and provide access to this array of String data.

Part of the functionality of the DataManager class is the
ability to import data from a file. This functionality is provided by
the DataImporter class, which is assumed to take a
non-trivial amount of time to initialize. This might be because a
DataImporter instance needs to open a file and read its
contents into memory when the DataImporter instance is
initialized.

It is possible for a DataManager instance to manage its
data without ever importing data from a file, so there is no need to
create a new DataImporter instance when the
DataManager itself is created. Instead, it makes more
sense to create the DataImporter instance if and when it
is first used.

Because it is marked with the @lazy attribute, the
DataImporter
property is only created when the importer property is
first accessed, such as when its fileName property is
queried:

    println)
    // the DataImporter instance for the importer property has now been created
    // prints "data.txt"

‌

### Stored Properties and Instance Variables 

If you have experience with Objective-C, you may know that it provides
*two* ways to store values and references as part of a class instance.
In addition to properties, you can use instance variables as a backing
store for the values stored in a property.

Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. A Swift
property does not have a corresponding instance variable, and the
backing store for a property is not accessed directly. This approach
avoids confusion about how the value is accessed in different contexts
and simplifies the property’s declaration into a single, definitive
statement. All information about the property—including its name, type,
and memory management characteristics—is defined in a single location as
part of the type’s definition.

‌

### Computed Properties 

In addition to stored properties, classes, structures, and enumerations
can define *computed properties*, which do not actually store a value.
Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and
set other properties and values indirectly.

    struct {
        var
    }
    struct {
        var =
    0.0
    }
    struct {
        var()
        var()
        var {
        get {
            let +
    (size)
            let +
    (size)
            return,
    y)
        }
        set) {
            origin -
    (size)
            origin -
    (size)
        }
        }
    }
    var:
    Point),
        size,
    height))
    let =
    square
    square:
    15.0)
    println)
    // prints "square.origin is now at (10.0, 10.0)"

This example defines three structures for working with geometric shapes:

    Point
    coordinate.

    Size and a
    height.

    Rect defines a rectangle by an origin point and a
    size.

The Rect structure also provides a computed property
called center. The current center position of a
Rect can always be determined from its
origin, and so you don’t need to
store the center point as an explicit Point value.
Instead, Rect defines a custom getter and setter for a
computed variable called center, to enable you to work
with the rectangle’s center as if it were a real stored
property.

The preceding example creates a new Rect variable called
square variable is initialized
with an origin point of (0, 0), and a width and height of
10. This square is represented by the blue square in the
diagram below.

The square property is
then accessed through dot syntax (square.center), which
causes the getter for center to be called, to retrieve
the current property value. Rather than returning an existing value, the
getter actually calculates and returns a new Point to
represent the center of the square. As can be seen above, the getter
correctly returns a center point of (5, 5).

The center property is then set to a new value of
(15, 15), which moves the square up and to the right, to
the new position shown by the orange square in the diagram below.
Setting the center property calls the setter for
center and
y property,
and moves the square to its new position.

‌

### Shorthand Setter Declaration 

If a computed property’s setter does not define a name for the new value
to be set, a default name of newValue is used. Here’s an
alternative version of the Rect structure, which takes
advantage of this shorthand notation:

    struct {
        var()
        var()
        var {
        get {
            let +
    (size)
            let +
    (size)
            return,
    y)
        }
        set {
            origin -
    (size)
            origin -
    (size)
        }
        }
    }

‌

### Read-Only Computed Properties 

A computed property with a getter but no setter is known as a *read-only
computed property*. A read-only computed property always returns a
value, and can be accessed through dot syntax, but cannot be set to a
different value.

Note

You must declare computed properties—including read-only computed
properties—as variable properties with the var keyword,
because their value is not fixed. The let keyword is only
used for constant properties, to indicate that their values cannot be
changed once they are set as part of instance initialization.

You can simplify the declaration of a read-only computed property by
removing the get keyword and its braces:

    struct {
        var =
    0.0
        var {
        return \*
    depth
        }
    }
    let =
    Cuboid,
    depth)
    println)
    // prints "the volume of fourByFiveByTwo is 40.0"

This example defines a new structure called Cuboid, which
represents a 3D rectangular box with width,
height properties. This
structure also has a read-only computed property called
volume, which calculates and returns the current volume
of the cuboid. It doesn’t make sense for volume to be
settable, because it would be ambiguous as to which values of
width
should be used for a particular volume value.
Nonetheless, it is useful for a Cuboid to provide a
read-only computed property to enable external users to discover its
current calculated volume.

‌

### Property Observers 

*Property observers* observe and respond to changes in a property’s
value. Property observers are called every time a property’s value is
set, even if the new value is the same as the property’s current value.

You can add property observers to any stored properties you define,
apart from lazy stored properties. You can also add property observers
to any inherited property (whether stored or computed) by overriding the
property within a subclass. Property overriding is described in
[Overriding](Inheritance.xhtml#TP40014097-CH17-XID_257).

Note

You don’t need to define property observers for non-overridden computed
properties, because you can observe and respond to changes to their
value from directly within the computed property’s setter.

You have the option to define either or both of these observers on a
property:

    willSet is called just before the value is stored.

    didSet is called immediately after the new value is
    stored.

If you implement a willSet observer, it is passed the new
property value as a constant parameter. You can specify a name for this
parameter as part of your willSet implementation. If you
choose not to write the parameter name and parentheses within your
implementation, the parameter will still be made available with a
default parameter name of newValue.

Similarly, if you implement a didSet observer, it will be
passed a constant parameter containing the old property value. You can
name the parameter if you wish, or use the default parameter name of
oldValue.

Note

willSet observers are not
called when a property is first initialized. They are only called when
the property’s value is set outside of an initialization context.

Here’s an example of willSet in
action. The example below defines a new class called
StepCounter, which tracks the total number of steps that
a person takes while walking. This class might be used with input data
from a pedometer or other step counter to keep track of a person’s
exercise during their daily routine.

    class {
        var {
        willSet) {
            println)
        }
        didSet {
            if {
                println
    - oldValue)
            }
        }
        }
    }
    let()
    stepCounter
    // About to set totalSteps to 200
    // Added 200 steps
    stepCounter
    // About to set totalSteps to 360
    // Added 160 steps
    stepCounter
    // About to set totalSteps to 896
    // Added 536 steps

The StepCounter class declares a
totalSteps. This is a
stored property with willSet
observers.

The willSet observers for
totalSteps are called whenever the property is assigned a
new value. This is true even if the new value is the same as the current
value.

This example’s willSet observer uses a custom parameter
name of newTotalSteps for the upcoming new value. In this
example, it simply prints out the value that is about to be set.

The didSet observer is called after the value of
totalSteps is updated. It compares the new value of
totalSteps against the old value. If the total number of
steps has increased, a message is printed to indicate how many new steps
have been taken. The didSet observer does not provide a
custom parameter name for the old value, and the default name of
oldValue is used instead.

Note

If you assign a value to a property within its own didSet
observer, the new value that you assign will replace the one that was
just set.

‌

### Global and Local Variables 

The capabilities described above for computing and observing properties
are also available to *global variables* and *local variables*. Global
variables are variables that are defined outside of any function,
method, closure, or type context. Local variables are variables that are
defined within a function, method, or closure context.

The global and local variables you have encountered in previous chapters
have all been *stored variables*. Stored variables, like stored
properties, provide storage for a value of a certain type and allow that
value to be set and retrieved.

However, you can also define *computed variables* and define observers
for stored variables, in either a global or local scope. Computed
variables calculate rather than store a value, and are written in the
same way as computed properties.

Note

Global constants and variables are always computed lazily, in a similar
manner to [Lazy Stored
Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_326). Unlike lazy
stored properties, global constants and variables do not need to be
marked with the @lazy attribute.

Local constants and variables are never computed lazily.

‌

### Type Properties 

Instance properties are properties that belong to an instance of a
particular type. Every time you create a new instance of that type, it
has its own set of property values, separate from any other instance.

You can also define properties that belong to the type itself, not to
any one instance of that type. There will only ever be one copy of these
properties, no matter how many instances of that type you create. These
kinds of properties are called *type properties*.

Type properties are useful for defining values that are universal to
*all* instances of a particular type, such as a constant property that
all instances can use (like a static constant in C), or a variable
property that stores a value that is global to all instances of that
type (like a static variable in C).

For value types (that is, structures and enumerations), you can define
stored and computed type properties. For classes, you can define
computed type properties only.

Stored type properties for value types can be variables or constants.
Computed type properties are always declared as variable properties, in
the same way as computed instance properties.

Note

Unlike stored instance properties, you must always give stored type
properties a default value. This is because the type itself does not
have an initializer that can assign a value to a stored type property at
initialization time.

‌

### Type Property Syntax 

In C and Objective-C, you define static constants and variables
associated with a type as *global* static variables. In Swift, however,
type properties are written as part of the type’s definition, within the
type’s outer curly braces, and each type property is explicitly scoped
to the type it supports.

You define type properties for value types with the
static keyword, and type properties for class types with
the class keyword. The example below shows the syntax for
stored and computed type properties:

    struct {
        static =
    "Some value."
        static:
    Int {
        // return an Int value here
        }
    }
    enum {
        static =
    "Some value."
        static:
    Int {
        // return an Int value here
        }
    }
    class {
        class:
    Int {
        // return an Int value here
        }
    }

Note

The computed type property examples above are for read-only computed
type properties, but you can also define read-write computed type
properties with the same syntax as for computed instance properties.

‌

### Querying and Setting Type Properties 

Type properties are queried and set with dot syntax, just like instance
properties. However, type properties are queried and set on the *type*,
not on an instance of that type. For example:

    println)
    // prints "42"
     
    println)
    // prints "Some value."
    SomeStructure =
    "Another value."
    println)
    // prints "Another value."

The examples that follow use two stored type properties as part of a
structure that models an audio level meter for a number of audio
channels. Each channel has an integer audio level between
0 inclusive.

The figure below illustrates how two of these audio channels can be
combined to model a stereo audio level meter. When a channel’s audio
level is 0, none of the lights for that channel are lit.
When the audio level is 10, all of the lights for that
channel are lit. In this figure, the left channel has a current level of
9, and the right channel has a current level of
7:

![image:
../Art/staticPropertiesVUMeter\_2x.png](Art/staticPropertiesVUMeter_2x.png)

The audio channels described above are represented by instances of the
AudioChannel structure:

    struct {
        static =
    10
        static
    maxInputLevelForAllChannels
        var {
        didSet {
            if \>
    AudioChannel {
                // cap the new audio level to the threshold level
                currentLevel =
    AudioChannel
            }
            if \>
    AudioChannel {
                // store this as the new overall maximum input level
                AudioChannel
    = currentLevel
            }
        }
        }
    }

The AudioChannel structure defines two stored type
properties to support its functionality. The first,
thresholdLevel, defines the maximum threshold value an
audio level can take. This is a constant value of 10 for
all AudioChannel instances. If an audio signal comes in
with a higher value than 10, it will be capped to this
threshold value (as described below).

The second type property is a variable stored property called
maxInputLevelForAllChannels. This keeps track of the
maximum input value that has been received by *any*
AudioChannel instance. It starts with an initial value of
0.

The AudioChannel structure also defines a stored instance
property called currentLevel, which represents the
channel’s current audio level on a scale of 0 to
10.

The currentLevel
property observer to check the value of currentLevel
whenever it is set. This observer performs two checks:

-   If the new value of currentLevel is greater than the
    allowed thresholdLevel, the property observer caps
    currentLevel.

-   If the new value of currentLevel (after any capping)
    is higher than any value previously received by *any*
    AudioChannel instance, the property observer stores
    the new currentLevel value in the
    maxInputLevelForAllChannels static property.

Note

In the first of these two checks, the didSet observer
sets currentLevel to a different value. This does not,
however, cause the observer to be called again.

You can use the AudioChannel structure to create two new
audio channels called leftChannel and
rightChannel, to represent the audio levels of a stereo
sound system:

    var()
    var()

If you set the currentLevel of the *left* channel to
7, you can see that the
maxInputLevelForAllChannels type property is updated to
equal 7:

    leftChannel
    println)
    // prints "7"
    println)
    // prints "7"

If you try to set the currentLevel of the *right* channel
to 11, you can see that the right channel’s
currentLevel property is capped to the maximum value of
10
type property is updated to equal 10:

    rightChannel
    println)
    // prints "10"
    println)
    // prints "10"
