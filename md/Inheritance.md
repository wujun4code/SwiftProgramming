Inheritance 
-----------

A class can *inherit* methods, properties, and other characteristics
from another class. When one class inherits from another, the inheriting
class is known as a *subclass*, and the class it inherits from is known
as its *superclass*. Inheritance is a fundamental behavior that
differentiates classes from other types in Swift.

Classes in Swift can call and access methods, properties, and subscripts
belonging to their superclass and can provide their own overriding
versions of those methods, properties, and subscripts to refine or
modify their behavior. Swift helps to ensure your overrides are correct
by checking that the override definition has a matching superclass
definition.

Classes can also add property observers to inherited properties in order
to be notified when the value of a property changes. Property observers
can be added to any property, regardless of whether it was originally
defined as a stored or computed property.

‌

### Defining a Base Class 

Any class that does not inherit from another class is known as a *base
class*.

Note

Swift classes do not inherit from a universal base class. Classes you
define without specifying a superclass automatically become base classes
for you to build upon.

The example below defines a base class called Vehicle.
This base class declares two properties (numberOfWheels
and maxPassengers) that are universal to all vehicles.
These properties are used by a method called description,
which returns a String description of the vehicle’s
characteristics:

    class {
        var
        var
        func {
            return
    "
        }
        init() {
            numberOfWheels
            maxPassengers
        }
    }

The Vehicle class also defines an *initializer* to set up
its properties. Initializers are described in detail in
[Initialization](Initialization.xhtml), but a brief introduction is
required here in order to illustrate how inherited properties can be
modified by subclasses.

You use initializers to create a new instance of a type. Although
initializers are not methods, they are written in a very similar syntax
to instance methods. An initializer prepares a new instance for use, and
ensures that all properties of the instance have valid initial values.

In its simplest form, an initializer is like an instance method with no
parameters, written using the init keyword:

    init() {
        // perform some initialization here
    }

To create a new instance of Vehicle, call this
initializer with *initializer syntax*, written as
TypeName followed by empty parentheses:

    let()

The initializer for Vehicle sets some initial property
values (numberOfWheels = 0 and
maxPassengers = 1) for an arbitrary vehicle.

The Vehicle class defines common characteristics for an
arbitrary vehicle, but is not much use in itself. To make it more
useful, you need to refine it to describe more specific kinds of
vehicle.

‌

### Subclassing 

*Subclassing* is the act of basing a new class on an existing class. The
subclass inherits characteristics from the existing class, which you can
refine. You can also add new characteristics to the subclass.

To indicate that a class has a superclass, write the superclass name
after the original class name, separated by a colon:

    class {
        // class definition goes here
    }

The next example defines a second, more specific vehicle called
Bicycle. This new class is based on the existing
capabilities of Vehicle. You indicate this by placing the
name of the class the subclass builds upon (Vehicle)
after its own name (Bicycle), separated by a colon.

This can be read as:

“Define a new class called Bicycle, which inherits the
characteristics of Vehicle”:

    class {
        init() {
            super()
            numberOfWheels
        }
    }

Bicycle, and
Vehicle. The
new Bicycle class automatically gains all characteristics
of Vehicle and
numberOfWheels properties. You can tailor those
characteristics and add new ones to better match the requirements of the
Bicycle class.

The Bicycle class also defines an initializer to set up
its tailored characteristics. The initializer for Bicycle
calls super.init(), the initializer for the
Bicycle, and
ensures that all of the inherited properties are initialized by
Vehicle tries to modify
them.

Note

Unlike Objective-C, initializers are not inherited by default in Swift.
For more information, see [Initializer Inheritance and
Overriding](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_290).

The default value of maxPassengers provided by
Vehicle is already correct for a bicycle, and so it is
not changed within the initializer for Bicycle. The
original value of numberOfWheels is not correct, however,
and is replaced with a new value of 2.

As well as inheriting the properties of Vehicle,
Bicycle also inherits its methods. If you create an
instance of Bicycle, you can call its inherited
description method to see how its properties have been
updated:

    let()
    println)
    // Bicycle: 2 wheels; up to 1 passengers

Subclasses can themselves be subclassed:

    class {
        init() {
            super()
            maxPassengers
        }
    }

This example creates a subclass of Bicycle for a
two-seater bicycle known as a “tandem”. Tandem inherits
the two properties from Bicycle, which in turn inherits
these properties from Vehicle
doesn’t change the number of wheels—it’s still a bicycle, after all—but
it does update maxPassengers to have the correct value
for a tandem.

Note

Subclasses are only allowed to modify *variable* properties of
superclasses during initialization. You can’t modify inherited constant
properties of subclasses.

Creating an instance of Tandem and printing its
description shows how its properties have been updated:

    let()
    println)
    // Tandem: 2 wheels; up to 2 passengers

Note that the description method is also inherited by
Tandem. Instance methods of a class are inherited by any
and all subclasses of that class.

‌

### Overriding 

A subclass can provide its own custom implementation of an instance
method, class method, instance property, or subscript that it would
otherwise inherit from a superclass. This is known as *overriding*.

To override a characteristic that would otherwise be inherited, you
prefix your overriding definition with the override
keyword. Doing so clarifies that you intend to provide an override and
have not provided a matching definition by mistake. Overriding by
accident can cause unexpected behavior, and any overrides without the
override keyword are diagnosed as an error when your code
is compiled.

The override keyword also prompts the Swift compiler to
check that your overriding class’s superclass (or one of its parents)
has a declaration that matches the one you provided for the override.
This check ensures that your overriding definition is correct.

‌

### Accessing Superclass Methods, Properties, and Subscripts 

When you provide a method, property, or subscript override for a
subclass, it is sometimes useful to use the existing superclass
implementation as part of your override. For example, you can refine the
behavior of that existing implementation or store a modified value in an
existing inherited variable.

Where this is appropriate, you access the superclass version of a
method, property, or subscript by using the super prefix:

-   An overridden method named someMethod can call the
    superclass version of someMethod by calling
    super.someMethod() within the overriding method
    implementation.

-   An overridden property called someProperty can access
    the superclass version of someProperty as
    super.someProperty within the overriding getter or
    setter implementation.

-   An overridden subscript for someIndex can access the
    superclass version of the same subscript as
    super[someIndex] from within the overriding subscript
    implementation.

‌

### Overriding Methods 

You can override an inherited instance or class method to provide a
tailored or alternative implementation of the method within your
subclass.

The following example defines a new subclass of Vehicle
called Car, which overrides the
description method it inherits from
Vehicle:

    class {
        var
        init() {
            super()
            maxPassengers
            numberOfWheels
        }
        override() -\>
    String {
            return() +
    "; "
                + "traveling at 
        }
    }

Car property
called speed. This property defaults to
0.0
also has a custom initializer, which sets the maximum number of
passengers to 5, and the default number of wheels to
4.

Car
method by providing a method with the same declaration as the
description. The
overriding method definition is prefixed with the
override keyword.

Rather than providing a completely custom implementation of
description, the overriding method actually starts by
calling super.description to retrieve the description
provided by Vehicle. It then appends some additional
information about the car’s current speed.

If you create a new instance of Car, and print the output
of its description method, you can see that the
description has indeed changed:

    let()
    println)
    // Car: 4 wheels; up to 5 passengers; traveling at 0.0 mph

‌

### Overriding Properties 

You can override an inherited instance or class property to provide your
own custom getter and setter for that property, or to add property
observers to enable the overriding property to observe when the
underlying property value changes.

‌

### Overriding Property Getters and Setters 

You can provide a custom getter (and setter, if appropriate) to override
*any* inherited property, regardless of whether the inherited property
is implemented as a stored or computed property at its source. The
stored or computed nature of an inherited property is not known by a
subclass—it only knows that the inherited property has a certain name
and type. You must always state both the name and the type of the
property you are overriding, to enable the compiler to check that your
override matches a superclass property with the same name and type.

You can present an inherited read-only property as a read-write property
by providing both a getter and a setter in your subclass property
override. You cannot, however, present an inherited read-write property
as a read-only property.

Note

If you provide a setter as part of a property override, you must also
provide a getter for that override. If you don’t want to modify the
inherited property’s value within the overriding getter, you can simply
pass through the inherited value by returning
super.someProperty from the getter, as in the
SpeedLimitedCar example below.

The following example defines a new class called
SpeedLimitedCar, which is a subclass of
Car class represents
a car that has been fitted with a speed-limiting device, which prevents
the car from traveling faster than 40mph. You implement this limitation
by overriding the inherited speed property:

    class {
        override {
        get {
            return
        }
        set {
            super =
    min)
        }
        }
    }

Whenever you set the speed property of a
SpeedLimitedCar instance, the property’s setter
implementation checks the new value and limits it to 40mph. It does this
by setting the underlying speed property of its
superclass to be the smaller of newValue and
40.0. The smaller of these two values is determined by
passing them to the min function, which is a global
function provided by the Swift standard library. The min
function takes two or more values and returns the smallest one of those
values.

If you try to set the speed property of a
SpeedLimitedCar instance to more than 40mph, and then
print the output of its description method, you see that
the speed has been limited:

    let()
    limitedCar
    println)
    // SpeedLimitedCar: 4 wheels; up to 5 passengers; traveling at 40.0 mph

‌

### Overriding Property Observers 

You can use property overriding to add property observers to an
inherited property. This enables you to be notified when the value of
the inherited property changes, regardless of how that property was
originally implemented. For more information on property observers, see
[Property Observers](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_333).

Note

You cannot add property observers to inherited constant stored
properties or inherited read-only computed properties. The value of
these properties cannot be set, and so it is not appropriate to provide
a willSet implementation as part
of an override.

Note also that you cannot provide both an overriding setter and an
overriding property observer. If you want to observe changes to a
property’s value, and you are already providing a custom setter for that
property, you can simply observe any value changes from within the
custom setter.

The following example defines a new class called
AutomaticCar.
The AutomaticCar class represents a car with an automatic
gearbox, which automatically selects an appropriate gear to use based on
the current speed. AutomaticCar also provides a custom
description method to print the current gear.

    class {
        var
        override {
        didSet {
            gear)
    + 1
        }
        }
        override() -\>
    String {
            return() +
    " in gear 
        }
    }

Whenever you set the speed property of an
AutomaticCar instance, the property’s
didSet observer automatically sets the
gear property to an appropriate choice of gear for the
new speed. Specifically, the property observer chooses a gear which is
the new speed, rounded
down to the nearest integer, plus 1. A speed of
10.0, and a speed of
35.0:

    let()
    automatic
    println)
    // AutomaticCar: 4 wheels; up to 5 passengers; traveling at 35.0 mph in gear 4

‌

### Preventing Overrides 

You can prevent a method, property, or subscript from being overridden
by marking it as *final*. Do this by writing the @final
attribute before its introducer keyword (such as
@final var,
@final class func).

Any attempts to override a final method, property, or subscript in a
subclass are reported as a compile-time error. Methods, properties or
subscripts that you add to a class in an extension can also be marked as
final within the extension’s definition.

You can mark an entire class as final by writing the
@final keyword
in its class definition (@final class). Any attempts to
subclass a final class will be reported as a compile-time error.
