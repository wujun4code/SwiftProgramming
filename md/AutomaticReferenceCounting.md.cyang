Automatic Reference Counting 
----------------------------

Swift uses *Automatic Reference Counting* (ARC) to track and manage your
app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management
“just works” in Swift, and you do not need to think about memory
management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class
instances when those instances are no longer needed.

However, in a few cases ARC requires more information about the
relationships between parts of your code in order to manage memory for
you. This chapter describes those situations and shows how you enable
ARC to manage all of your app’s memory.

Note

Reference counting only applies to instances of classes. Structures and
enumerations are value types, not reference types, and are not stored
and passed by reference.

‌

### How ARC Works 

Every time you create a new instance of a class, ARC allocates a chunk
of memory to store information about that instance. This memory holds
information about the type of the instance, together with the values of
any stored properties associated with that instance.

Additionally, when an instance is no longer needed, ARC frees up the
memory used by that instance so that the memory can be used for other
purposes instead. This ensures that class instances do not take up space
in memory when they are no longer needed.

However, if ARC were to deallocate an instance that was still in use, it
would no longer be possible to access that instance’s properties, or
call that instance’s methods. Indeed, if you tried to access the
instance, your app would most likely crash.

To make sure that instances don’t disappear while they are still needed,
ARC tracks how many properties, constants, and variables are currently
referring to each class instance. ARC will not deallocate an instance as
long as at least one active reference to that instance still exists.

To make this possible, whenever you assign a class instance to a
property, constant, or variable, that property, constant, or variable
makes a *strong reference* to the instance. The reference is called a
“strong“ reference because it keeps a firm hold on that instance, and
does not allow it to be deallocated for as long as that strong reference
remains.

‌

### ARC in Action 

Here’s an example of how Automatic Reference Counting works. This
example starts with a simple class called Person, which
defines a stored constant property called name:

    class {
        let
        init) {
            self
            println)
        }
        deinit {
            println)
        }
    }

The Person class has an initializer that sets the
instance’s name property and prints a message to indicate
that initialization is underway. The Person class also
has a deinitializer that prints a message when an instance of the class
is deallocated.

The next code snippet defines three variables of type
Person?, which are used to set up multiple references to
a new Person instance in subsequent code snippets.
Because these variables are of an optional type (Person?,
not Person), they are automatically initialized with a
value of nil, and do not currently reference a
Person instance.

    var?
    var?
    var?

You can now create a new Person instance and assign it to
one of these three variables:

    reference1:
    "John Appleseed")
    // prints "John Appleseed is being initialized"

Note that the message
"John Appleseed is being initialized" is printed at the
point that you call the Person class’s initializer. This
confirms that initialization has taken place.

Because the new Person instance has been assigned to the
reference1 variable, there is now a strong reference from
reference1 instance.
Because there is at least one strong reference, ARC makes sure that this
Person is kept in memory and is not deallocated.

If you assign the same Person instance to two more
variables, two more strong references to that instance are established:

    reference2
    reference3

There are now *three* strong references to this single
Person instance.

If you break two of these strong references (including the original
reference) by assigning nil to two of the variables, a
single strong reference remains, and the Person instance
is not deallocated:

    reference1
    reference2

ARC does not deallocate the Person instance until the
third and final strong reference is broken, at which point it is clear
that you are no longer using the Person instance:

    reference3
    // prints "John Appleseed is being deinitialized"

‌

### Strong Reference Cycles Between Class Instances 

In the examples above, ARC is able to track the number of references to
the new Person instance you create and to deallocate that
Person instance when it is no longer needed.

However, it is possible to write code in which an instance of a class
*never* gets to a point where it has zero strong references. This can
happen if two class instances hold a strong reference to each other,
such that each instance keeps the other alive. This is known as a
*strong reference cycle*.

You resolve strong reference cycles by defining some of the
relationships between classes as weak or unowned references instead of
as strong references. This process is described in [Resolving Strong
Reference Cycles Between Class
Instances](AutomaticReferenceCounting.xhtml#TP40014097-CH20-XID_55).
However, before you learn how to resolve a strong reference cycle, it is
useful to understand how such a cycle is caused.

Here’s an example of how a strong reference cycle can be created by
accident. This example defines two classes called Person
and Apartment, which model a block of apartments and its
residents:

    class {
        let
        init) {
    self
        var?
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }
     
    class {
        let
        init) {
    self
        var?
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }

Every Person property
of type String
property that is initially nil. The
apartment property is optional, because a person may not
always have an apartment.

Similarly, every Apartment instance has a
number and has an
optional tenant property that is initially
nil. The tenant property is optional because an apartment
may not always have a tenant.

Both of these classes also define a deinitializer, which prints the fact
that an instance of that class is being deinitialized. This enables you
to see whether instances of Person and
Apartment are being deallocated as expected.

This next code snippet defines two variables of optional type called
john, which will be set to a
specific Apartment instance
below. Both of these variables have an initial value of
nil, by virtue of being optional:

    var?
    var?

You can now create a specific Person instance and
Apartment instance and assign these new instances to the
john variables:

    john:
    "John Appleseed")
    number73)

Here’s how the strong references look after creating and assigning these
two instances. The john variable now has a strong
reference to the new Person instance, and the
number73 variable has a strong reference to the new
Apartment instance:

![image: ../Art/referenceCycle01\_2x.png](Art/referenceCycle01_2x.png)

You can now link the two instances together so that the person has an
apartment, and the apartment has a tenant. Note that an exclamation mark
(!) is used to unwrap and access the instances stored
inside the john optional
variables, so that the properties of those instances can be set:

    john
    number73

Here’s how the strong references look after you link the two instances
together:

![image: ../Art/referenceCycle02\_2x.png](Art/referenceCycle02_2x.png)

Unfortunately, linking these two instances creates a strong reference
cycle between them. The Person instance now has a strong
reference to the Apartment instance, and the
Apartment instance has a strong reference to the
Person instance. Therefore, when you break the strong
references held by the john
variables, the reference counts do not drop to zero, and the instances
are not deallocated by ARC:

    john
    number73

Note that neither deinitializer was called when you set these two
variables to nil. The strong reference cycle prevents the
Person instances from ever
being deallocated, causing a memory leak in your app.

Here’s how the strong references look after you set the
john variables to
nil:

![image: ../Art/referenceCycle03\_2x.png](Art/referenceCycle03_2x.png)

The strong references between the Person instance and the
Apartment instance remain and cannot be broken.

‌

### Resolving Strong Reference Cycles Between Class Instances 

Swift provides two ways to resolve strong reference cycles when you work
with properties of class type: weak references and unowned references.

Weak and unowned references enable one instance in a reference cycle to
refer to the other instance *without* keeping a strong hold on it. The
instances can then refer to each other without creating a strong
reference cycle.

Use a weak reference whenever it is valid for that reference to become
nil at some point during its lifetime. Conversely, use an
unowned reference when you know that the reference will never be
nil once it has been set during initialization.

‌

### Weak References 

A *weak reference* is a reference that does not keep a strong hold on
the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of
the referenced instance. This behavior prevents the reference from
becoming part of a strong reference cycle. You indicate a weak reference
by placing the weak keyword before a property or variable
declaration.

Use a weak reference to avoid reference cycles whenever it is possible
for that reference to have “no value” at some point in its life. If the
reference will *always* have a value, use an unowned reference instead,
as described in [Unowned
References](AutomaticReferenceCounting.xhtml#TP40014097-CH20-XID_58). In
the Apartment example above, it is appropriate for an
apartment to be able to have “no tenant” at some point in its lifetime,
and so a weak reference is an appropriate way to break the reference
cycle in this case.

Note

Weak references must be declared as variables, to indicate that their
value can change at runtime. A weak reference cannot be declared as a
constant.

Because weak references are allowed to have “no value”, you must declare
every weak reference as having an optional type. Optional types are the
preferred way to represent the possibility for “no value” in Swift.

Because a weak reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it
refers to, it is possible for that instance to be deallocated while the
weak reference is still referring to it. Therefore, ARC automatically
sets a weak reference to nil when the instance that it
refers to is deallocated. You can check for the existence of a value in
the weak reference, just like any other optional value, and you will
never end up with a reference to an invalid instance that no longer
exists.

The example below is identical to the Person and
Apartment example from above, with one important
difference. This time around, the Apartment type’s
tenant property is declared as a weak reference:

    class {
        let
        init) {
    self
        var?
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }
     
    class {
        let
        init) {
    self
        weak?
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }

The strong references from the two variables (john and
number73) and the links between the two instances are
created as before:

    var?
    var?
     
    john:
    "John Appleseed")
    number73)
     
    john
    number73

Here’s how the references look now that you’ve linked the two instances
together:

![image: ../Art/weakReference01\_2x.png](Art/weakReference01_2x.png)

The Person instance still has a strong reference to the
Apartment
instance now has a *weak* reference to the Person
instance. This means that when you break the strong reference held by
the john variables, there are no more strong references
to the Person instance:

![image: ../Art/weakReference02\_2x.png](Art/weakReference02_2x.png)

Because there are no more strong references to the Person
instance, it is deallocated:

    john
    // prints "John Appleseed is being deinitialized"

The only remaining strong reference to the Apartment
instance is from the number73 variable. If you break
*that* strong reference, there are no more strong references to the
Apartment instance:

![image: ../Art/weakReference03\_2x.png](Art/weakReference03_2x.png)

Because there are no more strong references to the
Apartment instance, it too is deallocated:

    number73
    // prints "Apartment #73 is being deinitialized"

The final two code snippets above show that the deinitializers for the
Person instance
print their “deinitialized” messages after the john and
number73. This
proves that the reference cycle has been broken.

‌

### Unowned References 

Like weak references, an *unowned reference* does not keep a strong hold
on the instance it refers to. Unlike a weak reference, however, an
unowned reference is assumed to *always* have a value. Because of this,
an unowned reference is always defined as a non-optional type. You
indicate an unowned reference by placing the unowned
keyword before a property or variable declaration.

Because an unowned reference is non-optional, you don’t need to unwrap
the unowned reference each time it is used. An unowned reference can
always be accessed directly. However, ARC cannot set the reference to
nil when the instance it refers to is deallocated,
because variables of a non-optional type cannot be set to
nil.

Note

If you try to access an unowned reference after the instance that it
references is deallocated, you will trigger a runtime error. Use unowned
references only when you are sure that the reference will *always* refer
to an instance.

Note also that Swift guarantees your app will crash if you try to access
an unowned reference after the instance it references is deallocated.
You will never encounter unexpected behavior in this situation. Your app
will always crash reliably, although you should, of course, prevent it
from doing so.

The following example defines two classes, Customer and
CreditCard, which model a bank customer and a possible
credit card for that customer. These two classes each store an instance
of the other class as a property. This relationship has the potential to
create a strong reference cycle.

The relationship between Customer and
CreditCard is slightly different from the relationship
between Apartment seen in the
weak reference example above. In this data model, a customer may or may
not have a credit card, but a credit card will *always* be associated
with a customer. To represent this, the Customer class
has an optional card property, but the
CreditCard class has a non-optional
customer property.

Furthermore, a new CreditCard instance can *only* be
created by passing a number value and a
customer
initializer. This ensures that a CreditCard instance
always has a customer instance associated with it when
the CreditCard instance is created.

Because a credit card will always have a customer, you define its
customer property as an unowned reference, to avoid a
strong reference cycle:

    class {
        let
        var?
        init) {
            self
        }
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }
     
    class {
        let
        unowned:
    Customer
        init:
    Customer) {
            self
            self
        }
        deinit {
    println)
    }
    }

This next code snippet defines an optional Customer
variable called john, which will be used to store a
reference to a specific customer. This variable has an initial value of
nil, by virtue of being optional:

    var?

You can now create a Customer instance, and use it to
initialize and assign a new CreditCard instance as that
customer’s card property:

    john:
    "John Appleseed")
    john:
    1234_5678_9012_3456!)

Here’s how the references look, now that you’ve linked the two
instances:

![image:
../Art/unownedReference01\_2x.png](Art/unownedReference01_2x.png)

The Customer instance now has a strong reference to the
CreditCard
instance has an unowned reference to the Customer
instance.

Because of the unowned customer reference, when you break
the strong reference held by the john variable, there are
no more strong references to the Customer instance:

![image:
../Art/unownedReference02\_2x.png](Art/unownedReference02_2x.png)

Because there are no more strong references to the
Customer instance, it is deallocated. After this happens,
there are no more strong references to the CreditCard
instance, and it too is deallocated:

    john
    // prints "John Appleseed is being deinitialized"
    // prints "Card #1234567890123456 is being deinitialized"

The final code snippet above shows that the deinitializers for the
Customer instance
both print their “deinitialized” messages after the john
variable is set to nil.

‌

### Unowned References and Implicitly Unwrapped Optional Properties 

The examples for weak and unowned references above cover two of the more
common scenarios in which it is necessary to break a strong reference
cycle.

The Person example shows a
situation where two properties, both of which are allowed to be
nil, have the potential to cause a strong reference
cycle. This scenario is best resolved with a weak reference.

The Customer example shows
a situation where one property that is allowed to be nil
and another property that cannot be nil have the
potential to cause a strong reference cycle. This scenario is best
resolved with an unowned reference.

However, there is a third scenario, in which *both* properties should
always have a value, and neither property should ever be
nil once initialization is complete. In this scenario, it
is useful to combine an unowned property on one class with an implicitly
unwrapped optional property on the other class.

This enables both properties to be accessed directly (without optional
unwrapping) once initialization is complete, while still avoiding a
reference cycle. This section shows you how to set up such a
relationship.

The example below defines two classes, Country and
City, each of which stores an instance of the other class
as a property. In this data model, every country must always have a
capital city, and every city must always belong to a country. To
represent this, the Country class has a
capitalCity class
has a country property:

    class {
        let
        let!
        init,
    capitalName) {
            self
            self =
    City:
    self)
        }
    }
     
    class {
        let
        unowned
        init:
    Country) {
            self
            self
        }
    }

To set up the interdependency between the two classes, the initializer
for City instance, and
stores this instance in its country property.

The initializer for City is called from within the
initializer for Country. However, the initializer for
Country to the
City
instance is fully initialized, as described in [Two-Phase
Initialization](Initialization.xhtml#TP40014097-CH18-XID_288).

To cope with this requirement, you declare the
capitalCity as an
implicitly unwrapped optional property, indicated by the exclamation
mark at the end of its type annotation (City!). This
means that the capitalCity property has a default value
of nil, like any other optional, but can be accessed
without the need to unwrap its value as described in [Implicitly
Unwrapped Optionals](TheBasics.xhtml#TP40014097-CH5-XID_436).

Because capitalCity
value, a new Country instance is considered fully
initialized as soon as the Country instance sets its
name property within its initializer. This means that the
Country initializer can start to reference and pass
around the implicit self property as soon as the
name
initializer can therefore pass self as one of the
parameters for the City initializer when the
Country initializer is setting its own
capitalCity property.

All of this means that you can create the Country and
City instances in a single statement, without creating a
strong reference cycle, and the capitalCity property can
be accessed directly, without needing to use an exclamation mark to
unwrap its optional value:

    var:
    "Canada")
    println)
    // prints "Canada's capital city is called Ottawa"

In the example above, the use of an implicitly unwrapped optional means
that all of the two-phase class initializer requirements are satisfied.
The capitalCity property can be used and accessed like a
non-optional value once initialization is complete, while still avoiding
a strong reference cycle.

‌

### Strong Reference Cycles for Closures 

You saw above how a strong reference cycle can be created when two class
instance properties hold a strong reference to each other. You also saw
how to use weak and unowned references to break these strong reference
cycles.

A strong reference cycle can also occur if you assign a closure to a
property of a class instance, and the body of that closure captures the
instance. This capture might occur because the closure’s body accesses a
property of the instance, such as self.someProperty, or
because the closure calls a method on the instance, such as
self.someMethod(). In either case, these accesses cause
the closure to “capture” self, creating a strong
reference cycle.

This strong reference cycle occurs because closures, like classes, are
*reference types*. When you assign a closure to a property, you are
assigning a *reference* to that closure. In essence, it’s the same
problem as above—two strong references are keeping each other alive.
However, rather than two class instances, this time it’s a class
instance and a closure that are keeping each other alive.

Swift provides an elegant solution to this problem, known as a *closure
capture list*. However, before you learn how to break a strong reference
cycle with a closure capture list, it is useful to understand how such a
cycle can be caused.

The example below shows how you can create a strong reference cycle when
using a closure that references self. This example
defines a class called HTMLElement, which provides a
simple model for an individual element within an HTML document:

    class {
        
        let
        let?
        
        @lazy: () -\>
    String = {
            if =
    self {
                return
    "<
            } else {
                return
    "<
            }
        }
        
        init:
    String) {
            self
            self
        }
        
        deinit {
            println)
        }
        
    }

The HTMLElement
property, which indicates the name of the element, such as
"p" for a
line break element. HTMLElement also defines an optional
text property, which you can set to a string that
represents the text to be rendered within that HTML element.

In addition to these two simple properties, the
HTMLElement class defines a lazy property called
asHTML. This property references a closure that combines
name into an HTML string
fragment. The asHTML property is of type
() -> String, or “a function that takes no parameters,
and returns a String value”.

By default, the asHTML property is assigned a closure
that returns a string representation of an HTML tag. This tag contains
the optional text value if it exists, or no text content
if text does not exist. For a paragraph element, the
closure would return "<p>some text</p>" or
"<p />"
property equals "some text".

The asHTML property is named and used somewhat like an
instance method. However, because asHTML is a closure
property rather than an instance method, you can replace the default
value of the asHTML property with a custom closure, if
you want to change the HTML rendering for a particular HTML element.

Note

The asHTML property is declared as a lazy property,
because it is only needed if and when the element actually needs to be
rendered as a string value for some HTML output target. The fact that
asHTML is a lazy property means that you can refer to
self within the default closure, because the lazy
property will not be accessed until after initialization has been
completed and self is known to exist.

The HTMLElement class provides a single initializer,
which takes a name argument and (if desired) a
text argument to initialize a new element. The class also
defines a deinitializer, which prints a message to show when an
HTMLElement instance is deallocated.

Here’s how you use the HTMLElement class to create and
print a new instance:

    var? =
    HTMLElement:
    "hello, world")
    println())
    // prints "<p>hello, world</p>"

Note

The paragraph variable above is defined as an *optional*
HTMLElement
below to demonstrate the presence of a strong reference cycle.

Unfortunately, the HTMLElement class, as written above,
creates a strong reference cycle between an HTMLElement
instance and the closure used for its default asHTML
value. Here’s how the cycle looks:

![image:
../Art/closureReferenceCycle01\_2x.png](Art/closureReferenceCycle01_2x.png)

The instance’s asHTML property holds a strong reference
to its closure. However, because the closure refers to
self within its body (as a way to reference
self.name), the closure
*captures* self, which means that it holds a strong reference back to
the HTMLElement instance. A strong reference cycle is
created between the two. (For more information about capturing values in
a closure, see [Capturing
Values](Closures.xhtml#TP40014097-CH11-XID_129).)

Note

Even though the closure refers to self multiple times, it
only captures one strong reference to the HTMLElement
instance.

If you set the paragraph
and break its strong reference to the HTMLElement
instance, neither the HTMLElement instance nor its
closure are deallocated, because of the strong reference cycle:

    paragraph

Note that the message in the HTMLElement deinitializer is
not printed, which shows that the HTMLElement instance is
not deallocated.

‌

### Resolving Strong Reference Cycles for Closures 

You resolve a strong reference cycle between a closure and a class
instance by defining a *capture list* as part of the closure’s
definition. A capture list defines the rules to use when capturing one
or more reference types within the closure’s body. As with strong
reference cycles between two class instances, you declare each captured
reference to be a weak or unowned reference rather than a strong
reference. The appropriate choice of weak or unowned depends on the
relationships between the different parts of your code.

Note

Swift requires you to write self.someProperty or
self.someMethod (rather than just
someProperty) whenever you
refer to a member of self within a closure. This helps
you remember that it’s possible to capture self by
accident.

‌

### Defining a Capture List 

Each item in a capture list is a pairing of the weak or
unowned keyword with a reference to a class instance
(such as self). These
pairings are written within a pair of square braces, separated by
commas.

Place the capture list before a closure’s parameter list and return type
if they are provided:

    @lazy,
    String = {
        [unowned,
    stringToProcess
        // closure body goes here
    }

If a closure does not specify a parameter list or return type because
they can be inferred from context, place the capture list at the very
start of the closure, followed by the in keyword:

    @lazy: () -\>
    String = {
        [unowned
        // closure body goes here
    }

‌

### Weak and Unowned References 

Define a capture in a closure as an unowned reference when the closure
and the instance it captures will always refer to each other, and will
always be deallocated at the same time.

Conversely, define a capture as a weak reference when the captured
reference may become nil at some point in the future.
Weak references are always of an optional type, and automatically become
nil when the instance they reference is deallocated. This
enables you to check for their existence within the closure’s body.

Note

If the captured reference will never become nil, it
should always be captured as an unowned reference, rather than a weak
reference.

An unowned reference is the appropriate capture method to use to resolve
the strong reference cycle in the HTMLElement example
from earlier. Here’s how you write the HTMLElement class
to avoid the cycle:

    class {
        
        let
        let?
        
        @lazy: () -\>
    String = {
            [unowned
            if =
    self {
                return
    "<
            } else {
                return
    "<
            }
        }
        
        init:
    String) {
            self
            self
        }
        
        deinit {
            println)
        }
        
    }

This implementation of HTMLElement is identical to the
previous implementation, apart from the addition of a capture list
within the asHTML closure. In this case, the capture list
is [unowned self], which means “capture self as an
unowned reference rather than a strong reference”.

You can create and print an HTMLElement instance as
before:

    var? =
    HTMLElement:
    "hello, world")
    println())
    // prints "<p>hello, world</p>"

Here’s how the references look with the capture list in place:

This time, the capture of self by the closure is an
unowned reference, and does not keep a strong hold on the
HTMLElement instance it has captured. If you set the
strong reference from the paragraph variable to
nil instance is
deallocated, as can be seen from the printing of its deinitializer
message in the example below:

    paragraph
    // prints "p is being deinitialized"
