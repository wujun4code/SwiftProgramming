Attributes 
----------

*Attributes* provide more information about a declaration or type. There
are two kinds of attributes in Swift, those that apply to declarations
and those that apply to types. For instance, the required
attribute—when applied to a designated or convenience initializer
declaration of a class—indicates that every subclass must implement that
initializer. And the noreturn attribute—when applied to a
function or method type—indicates that the function or method doesn’t
return to its caller.

You specify an attribute by writing the @ symbol followed
by the attribute’s name and any arguments that the attribute accepts:

-   ~~~~ 
    @attribute name
    ~~~~

-   ~~~~ 
    @attribute name(attribute arguments)
    ~~~~

Some declaration attributes accept arguments that specify more
information about the attribute and how it applies to a particular
declaration. These *attribute arguments* are enclosed in parentheses,
and their format is defined by the attribute they belong to.

‌

### Declaration Attributes 

You can apply a declaration attribute to declarations only. However, you
can also apply the noreturn attribute to a function or
method *type*.

assignment
:   Apply this attribute to functions that overload a compound
    assignment operator. Functions that overload a compound assignment
    operator must mark their initial input parameter as
    inout. For an example of how to use the
    assignment attribute, see [Compound Assignment
    Operators](AdvancedOperators.xhtml#TP40014097-CH27-XID_45).

class_protocol
:   Apply this attribute to a protocol to indicate that the protocol can
    be adopted by class types only.

    If you apply the objc attribute to a protocol, the
    class_protocol attribute is implicitly applied to
    that protocol; there’s no need to mark the protocol with the
    class_protocol attribute explicitly.

exported
:   Apply this attribute to an import declaration to export the imported
    module, submodule, or declaration from the current module. If
    another module imports the current module, that other module can
    access the items exported by the current module.

final
:   Apply this attribute to a class or to a property, method, or
    subscript member of a class. It’s applied to a class to indicate
    that the class can’t be subclassed. It’s applied to a property,
    method, or subscript of a class to indicate that that class member
    can’t be overridden in any subclass.

lazy
:   Apply this attribute to a stored variable property of a class or
    structure to indicate that the property’s initial value is
    calculated and stored at most once, when the property is first
    accessed. For an example of how to use the lazy
    attribute, see [Lazy Stored
    Properties](Properties.xhtml#TP40014097-CH14-XID_326).

noreturn
:   Apply this attribute to a function or method declaration to indicate
    that the corresponding type of that function or method,
    T. You can mark a
    function or method type with this attribute to indicate that the
    function or method doesn’t return to its caller.

    You can override a function or method that is not marked with the
    noreturn attribute with a function or method that is.
    That said, you can’t override a function or method that is marked
    with the noreturn attribute with a function or method
    that is not. Similar rules apply when you implement a protocol
    method in a conforming type.

NSCopying
:   Apply this attribute to a stored variable property of a class. This
    attribute causes the property’s setter to be synthesized with a
    *copy* of the property’s value—returned by the
    copyWithZone method—instead of the value of the
    property itself. The type of the property must conform to the
    NSCopying protocol.

    The NSCopying attribute behaves in a way similar to
    the Objective-C copy property attribute.

NSManaged
:   Apply this attribute to a stored variable property of a class that
    inherits from NSManagedObject to indicate that the
    storage and implementation of the property are provided dynamically
    by Core Data at runtime based on the associated entity description.

objc
:   Apply this attribute to any declaration that can be represented in
    Objective-C—for example, non-nested classes, protocols, properties
    and methods (including getters and setters) of classes and
    protocols, initializers, deinitializers, and subscripts. The
    objc attribute tells the compiler that a declaration
    is available to use in Objective-C code.

    If you apply the objc attribute to a class or
    protocol, it’s implicitly applied to the members of that class or
    protocol. The compiler also implicitly adds the objc
    attribute to a class that inherits from another class marked with
    the objc attribute. Protocols marked with the
    objc attribute can’t inherit from protocols that
    aren’t.

    The objc attribute optionally accepts a single
    attribute argument, which consists of an identifier. Use this
    attribute when you want to expose a different name to Objective-C
    for the entity the objc attribute applies to. You can
    use this argument to name classes, protocols, methods, getters,
    setters, and initializers. The example below exposes the getter for
    the enabled property of the
    ExampleClass to Objective-C code as
    isEnabled rather than just as the name of the
    property itself.

        @objc
        class {
            var {
            @objc {
                // Return the appropriate value
            }
            }
        }

optional
:   Apply this attribute to a protocol’s property, method, or subscript
    members to indicate that a conforming type isn’t required to
    implement those members.

    You can apply the optional attribute only to
    protocols that are marked with the objc attribute. As
    a result, only class types can adopt and conform to a protocol that
    contains optional member requirements. For more information about
    how to use the optional attribute and for guidance
    about how to access optional protocol members—for example, when
    you’re not sure whether a conforming type implements them—see
    [Optional Protocol
    Requirements](Protocols.xhtml#TP40014097-CH25-XID_365).

required
:   Apply this attribute to a designated or convenience initializer of a
    class to indicate that every subclass must implement that
    initializer.

    Required designated initializers must be implemented explicitly.
    Required convenience initializers can be either implemented
    explicitly or inherited when the subclass directly implements all of
    the superclass’s designated initializers (or when the subclass
    overrides the designated initializers with convenience
    initializers).

### Declaration Attributes Used by Interface Builder 

Interface Builder attributes are declaration attributes used by
Interface Builder to synchronize with Xcode. Swift provides the
following Interface Builder attributes: IBAction,
IBDesignable, and
IBOutlet. These attributes are conceptually the same as
their Objective-C counterparts.

You apply the IBOutlet
attributes to property declarations of a class. You apply the
IBAction attribute to method declarations of a class and
the IBDesignable attribute to class declarations.

‌

### Type Attributes 

You can apply type attributes to types only. However, you can also apply
the noreturn attribute to a function or method
*declaration*.

auto_closure
:   This attribute is used to delay the evaluation of an expression by
    automatically wrapping that expression in a closure with no
    arguments. Apply this attribute to a function or method type that
    takes no arguments and that returns the type of the expression. For
    an example of how to use the auto_closure attribute,
    see [Function Type](Types.xhtml#TP40014097-CH31-XID_1005).

noreturn
:   Apply this attribute to the type of a function or method to indicate
    that the function or method doesn’t return to its caller. You can
    also mark a function or method declaration with this attribute to
    indicate that the corresponding type of that function or method,
    T.
